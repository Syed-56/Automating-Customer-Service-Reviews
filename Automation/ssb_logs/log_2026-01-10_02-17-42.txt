Service, please.
Perfect.
Can I have your first or last name, please?

Hold, sir.
Thank you.
Let me transfer you to the service department, please hold.
Service?
Lisa Colster is on the line needing service assistance.
Can I connect you to the caller?
Yes.
Thank you for calling Brother Service.
This is Kia or having a help, babe.
Hi, Kia.
My name is Lisa Colster and I am having the same exact problem with my passenger side seat
that I've had since I've bought my Jeep.
And it's really annoying.
Um, so now the parts were replaced.
And I, my car got a warranty, it's got 37,000 miles, and I will be getting them in a standard
warranty, but I need to be able to put somebody in my passenger seat.
I mean, I'm so frustrated over this.
That's right here.
Actually right near you guys, somebody has time to take a quick look at it, but I know
that might not happen.
You're more than welcome to come to, well, they're, they're, they're going to want to
launch right now.
So it's 12.
Okay.
I mean, I come after one and you can speak with someone, but they're probably still going
to tell you a schedule and appointment.
Our service department is booked out.
So they're booking out to like the 20, 20 nights at the moment.
I know if somebody could just like, come out and look at it, the back won't latch.
So if you're sitting in it, you know, you can push it back with your back and, you know,
sit relatively comfortable, but, you know, yeah, it just doesn't cut it.
Well, if you want to, like I said, you're more than welcome to stop by if you're in the
area and speak with a service advisor or with a service manager to see what they can
suggest before you schedule an appointment.
That's totally fine as well.
Yeah, because it's just the parts that are under warranty that they had to replace.
I mean, I had to wait like, because it's a tiny little piece of red, you know, in lots
of forms that people are having the same problem.
And if you want probably, I'm not 100% sure if the sheet would be willing to help you out,
but it's worth a try.
They may be able to help you out if you want to give them a call.
Yeah, because I mean, I should.
It could give them a call because, you know, the parts to the seat that you replaced are
under warranty, but it's something new.
I mean, the receipt, the seat supposedly was replaced very shortly after I bought it,
because it started that soon, like 2000 miles.
So, yeah.
All right.
So what I'll do is I'll try to hang out and, um,
stop by and see if somebody can look and if not, I'll schedule a report, but I just really,
it's got to be the same problem because it's doing the same thing.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I was like, yeah, there's so many times you want to stop by and tilt like they can get
just scheduled.
But in the meantime, I found where you are reached out to Jesus as well, since it's,
you know, it's something that you're familiar with being that is happening on the passenger
side too.
Do you know what their number is for?
Yeah.
What is that number?
Seven.
All righty.
I'll request it in because this is kind of bogus.
I mean, if it just started happening, I could see it, but it's been doing it since I owned
the car and it was raining and we're having a lot of it.
Hopefully they can like help you out at least something.
It's worth a try.
I know.
It is worth a try.
So I appreciate it.
And, um, they come back from one to one or twelve years, they do one.
One.
Okay.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
