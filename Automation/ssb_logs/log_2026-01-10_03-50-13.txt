Honda ERB sport hybrid
Mm-hmm. I just got back to work. I got in my car and
It's just off on me
automatically says something about tire pressure
and parking brake
I'm sorry. So what you're saying about the tire pressure light is on and then there's something wrong with the parking brake
Okay, what I'm saying is my car keeps shutting off after I started
and saying well, let's see what it says
So I press on the brake pedal and I won't do anything. Oh my god. Wow. I'm gonna get home from my edgerton
You're on the way on the edgerton. Is that just where you work? Yes. Yep. That's about that
I didn't look like this car had power now
Wow
Unreal. I've never had an issue with this car. I'm not once
No one time
If you are able to get it towed to us we can get it looked at
And then if you were to come with the tow truck, we could possibly put you into a loner

um after that we do have a drop box next to like
um

And if you do end up coming with the tow truck driver
Um
I would say try to have a ride come get you and then
Um, we open tomorrow from seven to three so you can come back and we can get you into a loner than if you don't make it
before

So, I need I need taking you guys leave me a vehicle
