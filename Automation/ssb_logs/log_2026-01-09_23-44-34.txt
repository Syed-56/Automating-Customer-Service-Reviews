and calling your purely services events.
How do I help you?
Yes, these are available, please?
Yes.
These are actually out today.
He'll be back on Monday.
Yes.
There's so much maybe he helped you out with?
Hopefully.
So I was there at MDX, last name is Cavill, C-A-D-I-L.
David?
Yes, sir.
Was there on Tuesday?
These are healthy Ls.
So the car, like lane keys, that type of, I
got a couple of errors on the computer.
There was some alignment issue.
They corrected it.
What's not corrected at this point
is any type of mirror notification when I have, like,
blind spot and other than a blind spot indicator is a mirror,
that stuff is still not working.
No problem.
Now, clearly quite David, I hate to ask,
but I do want to ask, the blind spot warning is activated.
Is that correct?
Yes.
So that's the little light, parking light on the left side
of the steering wheel.
So that's the parking center.
With a P on it, that you can press in and out.
They have a screen light that comes on.
And if I'm not mistaken, we have a N26-N-D-S, is that right there?
Yep.
That's right.
OK.
So on that same panel, there should
be a car with a circle around it.
Is that right?
Yep.
OK, if you press that button in, on the display screen
where the odometer would be, you'll
have a screen that comes up that shows you
three different sections.
There should be one with a car, a little center,
and then a little car to the bottom right.
You see that?
You see, yep, there's three things.
Are all three of those boxes, chef?
No, just the bottom one.
And what picture of the bottom one is the show?
What kind of picture is that?
It shows a car with a little green star and a little bit
of something behind it, like the back end of the car.
Is that indicator right?
And then there's a lane of the top one
is like a car leaving a lane.
And the other one, isn't it?
Yeah.
So this is an awesome call, because you're fixing it for me.
I just need to check those other two on, you're saying?
Yeah.
Yeah, make sure all three of those are checked in.
And then if you're still having an instant,
it's giving you a call back.
Be more happy to go through it and see what's going on,
what's happening, if it's not operating correctly.
No, I'm sure this is going to face
it, thanks, I'm an idiot, I appreciate it, I hope.
Hey, no problem at all, David, yeah, give me a call.
My name is Ben, let me know if there's anything I do for you.
If it's still all working, please let me know.
We'll get you fixed up.
OK.
All right, thanks.
All right, appreciate it.
You guys, my pleasure, thank you.
Yeah, take care, bye.
