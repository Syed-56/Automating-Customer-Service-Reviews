It's a great day here at San Antonio Dodge.
This is Alexis. How may this be in front of you for today?
Is there anyone from the parts department that I can talk to for a second?
Yeah, definitely. One moment. I'll get you over to someone.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
The parts department? This is it?
Is this a parts department? Yes.
Okay, good question. I don't know if you might have the answer.
I was trying to reach service, but I'm thinking this understanding simply.
On a wagon near 2022, I replaced an airbag.
Do I have to replace the module as well?
Like a curtain airbag? Yes.
What do you mean by the module?
The airbag module? What vehicle do you have?
It's 2022. Do you have a wagon air?
Two way.
Maybe we want to restart my catalog.
Five percent. Okay.
2022. G.
Five in a year. Do you look at the 3.0 liter? 5.7?
5.7, yes.
7. Okay.
This is a good one.
Two times. I'm taking another look.
This is a high look.
I'm not too familiar with the preparing or changing like airbags.
Let me go check with the back counter.
I do a lot of those with the shots.
So let me go after them. Okay.
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Yeah, no problem.
You still left? Yes, sir.
Okay.
So the airbag deployed, correct, and you were replacing it?
Yes.
Okay. Yeah, you're going to have to replace the module.
Okay. And it's going to need a program, right?
As well. Paying the module.
I believe so.
Okay. Sorry enough. Thank you so much, sir. I really appreciate it.
Yeah, of course. All right. Bye-bye.
