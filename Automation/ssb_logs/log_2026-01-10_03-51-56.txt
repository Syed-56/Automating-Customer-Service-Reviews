And to my name is Yvonne, how can I help you?
Hi, Yvonne.
I just made an appointment for a little bit later this afternoon
for a service online Honda.
But I did have a question.
I got a notification online, a dash that said, you know,
it's time for service.
But sometimes that's off a little bit from your record.
So can you just double check and make sure it's time for me to come in?
Yes, of course.
Let me share with your phone number.
6-6-0-1.
Thank you.
And let's see, first and lastly, on the account?
It's either Sherry or Elise.
Elise, I go by my middle name, Lundine, L-U-N-V-E-N.
Thank you.
OK.
And then just confirm also the year and model of the vehicle.
It's a Honda CRV 2018.
Thank you.
OK.
Last time that you came in for an oil change, the vehicle was at 76,000 miles.
What's the current mileage now?
It's 86, 6, 3, 9.
86, yeah, it's been 10,000 miles.
So, yeah, it sounds about right.
Let's get to for service.
OK.
OK, great.
So I'll see you in an hour.
Thank you.
All right, thank you.
We'll see you soon.
Thank you.
OK.
Bye-bye.
