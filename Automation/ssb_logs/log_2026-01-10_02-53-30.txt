Now, can you like to serve as the player?
I'm happy to speak.
Yes.
I think you called me before this morning, okay, about my car, about service to be done,
but it's been like 2018.
Okay.
Did you want help setting up an appointment?
No.
No, actually, I don't think the service needed to be done.
I mean, when I purchased a car, it was around 49,000 miles.
It was only close to 53.
Shouldn't be 7,000 to do the service?
Let me check here.
Let me pull up your vehicle here.
What was your telephone number?
Okay.
This is a 2018 MX-400.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's take a look here.
It was first, though, when you were like 49.
Yeah.
So we're giving you a call base off of time.
We're making the routine services to be held every six months or 5,000 miles, whichever comes first.
So we're letting you know, based off of time, your vehicle is due for its routine service.
Okay.
Let me have to something.
What does that mean?
That kind of service.
I mean, why has to be done every six months?
What do they do on services?
Is it all changed yet?
Is not every 10,000?
No.
So, yeah, you're correct on that.
It will change every 10,000 miles, but the other routine services are held every six months.
Set up that way for people that don't put a lot of miles on their vehicle.
So let's say you're only driving like 1,000 miles a year.
Well, it's still important to get your routine services done and days off of time.
Since you're not really putting a lot of miles on it.
Some of those components and fluids do have a shelf life.
So you have to replace them on a regular interval.
Okay.
Well, what kind of components do you get every place?
I mean, I don't understand.
Yeah.
So like I said, when they bring it in, the service advisor will go over the vehicle with you.
Obviously, if it's an oil change that was already done, it's good for 10,000 miles or one year.
But other items in the vehicle, like topping out your fluids, tire rotation, checking the filters, things like that would be done on a regular interval of six months or 5,000 miles.
Yeah.
Well, what kind of filter, for example?
I mean, the filters, but they always change filters, right?
I don't think what other filters do they have.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't think like your cabin air filter, engine air filter, things like that.
They would check my device to change if it hasn't been changed before.
But that's something they would check out on your service.
Right.
When the car comes, you know, the day of the purchase, I mean, the oil change I suppose probably was going to, it was done before you were giving it to me, right?
So don't suppose, if that's the car doesn't have any light warning for oil change?
No.
So like I said, I was calling you based off of time.
No, no, I understand.
I understand.
But also my question is like, when you need to do oil change, does the car advise you that you need to do the oil change?
Does it have a sensor that tells you?
Yeah.
The vehicle will let you know and will give you a call when it's fine for an oil change that's done every year or 10,000 miles, whichever comes first.
Okay.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure you guys charge you for oil change?
Oil change is $149.95.
Okay.
And that routine service that you've told me, how much you guys are charging for it?
Depending on the service, but usually it's around $180, could be more, could be less depending on what's going to be done.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Well, thank you for the call.
Okay.
I'll strike with you a little later on.
Thank you.
Sure.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
