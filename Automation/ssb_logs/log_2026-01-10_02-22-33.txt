Thank you for calling suburban kind of like employment service. How can we help you?
Yes, I called yesterday
I'm trying to see when well, I know the part came in from her car
But no one's called me and I'm trying to see when I could bring it in to get
It puts on that it was ordered. I think on like December 19
Okay, you know who your advisor you are working with
No
It was my car was told there cuz my battery went dead and I had needed an oil
Change as well
But we paid for the part while we were there that day and I called yesterday and
The gentleman did tell me in parts. He did tell me that it was there
But no one's calling you to see it there or when they could put it on
Okay
Yeah, sometimes it's interesting when the part team tells customers that the parts are here
Sometimes they don't tell us
I believe and I'm like what the heck and I did call yesterday. I left the messes, but the general I think it was
Robert or what? I don't know, but I never got a call back in late here
Yeah, and he's he's actually already gone for the day, but it doesn't look like that he was the one
That worked with you here
It's a just a battery we place the replace the battery
Mm-hmm
Did he say what the part was it was a word but the part was like I know it was it flew off
We were riding on the freeway. It was like a like a silver piece
That's right under the hood almost it kind of like part of the rim not rim, but
the outline I'm probably describing how wrong but
It's just a silver
Like literally like a silver piece that kind of came flew off while driving on the freeway with a high wind
That's what I don't know what they call it, but we pay for it is only like 60 something bucks for the chart
And we're we're in the vehicle. We pulled the part up that we pay for the part we were there
They check on my account. I don't see any part being pre-ordered or purchased on like the service side
So I'm wondering did you buy it from like the parts counter?
No, we were just right back there where you get the oil changer
And you pay for like with the rest of it we pay for the we pay almost 700 some bucks pay for the battery
You know the battery the the labor of putting in the battery
We pay for the oil change of which we weren't supposed to pay for but we pay for the oil change and then we pay for that part
Yeah, I'm looking at the invoice here
Of the last time you were here like for that exact service, and I don't see any other than the oil change in the battery
That no the audience in the battery was on one invoice, and then he gave us another one
Yeah for the part for this piece. I'm talking about 60 something bucks
And this was back in the same time now back in December same day. Mm-hmm
Correct, so that's why I'm curious like would that a part invoice or something because I don't have any
I'm just and I'm I'm sorry. I'm just looking at this from the outside like I don't see I
Don't see anything in here for like a six dollar car
This is I can't stand this place like literally every time I call it. It's always so many hoops like you have to jump through
It's try this person try that person like I have no idea. We were just in that one area not all over the place now one area
We pick the car
The totals on it and then that part was I don't I'm at work, and I don't have it right now
Okay, cuz I just thought about it because I'm like no one calling me bet. What was that?
Well, I can't see it if I like if it's not, you know
Yesterday
Because the parts department they're technically like they have a different system that they use so like I can't be part inventory or
Receipts, or you know, I have a different system over there. They can't see kind of how it goes on our end
So it's you know, okay, it's a little bit of a it can be a little weird
Right, okay
Like I don't know if that they just went ahead and had something ordered for you and it's not like that
Yeah, so I don't know that's that's so do you guys not talk to parts like you can't reach out to the parts that act or
See what's going on
Well, that would be where I would have to start. Yeah, I mean, okay
But I would need like a
Computer an invoice or something that way I can have them look it up if they will know
Maybe they can fill me in and things just yeah
I gave him my name and my phone number and he was able to pull it up
So can I give you my name and number?
What why already have everything pulled up like I was telling you I can see the previous invoice and that's where my
Cuz I don't see any kind of
You know, okay, so can you give the guy and parts my name and number since he was able to tell me yesterday that it was there
Maybe he can tell you that
Yeah, so I don't I mean at least you can tell me what's going on like cuz if if he has the order at least he can tell me like okay
How it was ordered is what right?
Okay, okay
And then from there, yeah, we can definitely schedule to come in like if it's a minor part like I don't you know
See why we can be able to do that
Okay, so will someone will you give me a call back and let me know after you talk to the guy?
Yeah, I can do that. Okay. I appreciate it. It's a
Yes, yeah, okay, all right, okay, and when if I don't hear from you
Okay, and then I will look cuz like I said, I'm at work now and as you saw about I like they haven't called me again today
So I will when I get home and hopefully guys aren't close
But if I get home before you guys close, I'll try and call back and and I can give you what do you want the invoice number?
Yeah, I mean if you know anything that would help me look it up, but it sounds like the part theme already is kind of aware of it
So they should be able to provide me the information that we need as long as I give them
You know your name is okay
Okay, so can you just call me and let me know what's the status and then we can go from there
Yeah
Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. Yep. No problem. Have a good one. Uh-huh. Bye bye
