Thank you for calling 5.4 dollars. This is the list of how my director calls.
Hi, I was calling for Felix.
Sure, one on me. Thank you.
Welcome.
Hello, this is Brian here for 5.4.
5.4 service. I'm going to help you.
And, of course, Felix, please.
This is Felix.
Hey, Felix, this is Courtney Lawless, and my hit, my hit, lawless.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The big F-250 with the noise permission.
Okay.
All right, so we got everything, got the rear axle rebuilt in the vehicle, and the stop-form
and the technician went on the test drive, and it's still making noise.
Right.
And it's coming from the rear axle, so we've submitted or the stop-form and has submitted
a technical assistance request to Ford.
Mm-hmm.
More than likely, he hasn't heard back from them yet.
More than likely what they're going to do is to send us a whole new rear axle, not have
us rebuilt the existing one.
Oh, okay.
The rear, it may be damaged on the inside of the housing, and that may be what's causing
the noise, and we just can't see it, because it just takes a little groove, or, you know,
if they're better, it's just one little imperfection, and it can cause a noise.
So we're thinking that they're more than likely going to tell us, just send us a whole
new rear axle to put in the truck.
Okay.
But they have not heard back from technical assistance.
They submitted it yesterday, and for, because they're getting requests from all across the
country, back where all around the world, who, every Ford dealer, they submit this information,
and they submit these requests for assistance, so they always tell us to be prepared for one
to two business days to get a response from a day from it yesterday afternoon, and, you know,
it's just barely 24 hours, so one of two business days is going to carry us into Monday,
so we're thinking that they're probably going to just send us a whole new rear axle on it.
So I just wanted to reach out to see how much and know where we were at on it, you know,
we did, we did our due diligence, we did what they told us through, and unfortunately, it
didn't work.
Okay.
Well, I know y'all just bought, you know, really basically just bought this truck.
Yeah.
And the last thing y'all wanted to be in the shop this long, and I apologize for that on
our part, but we've got to do what Ford tells us to do.
So I'll just keep you in the loop and let you know what I find out on Monday about it.
Okay.
That's not fair.
Sounds good.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Let's do it.
All right.
Appreciate you.
Thank you for all your patience.
