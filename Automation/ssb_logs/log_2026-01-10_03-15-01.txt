Hi, I have a 2019 Ram 1500, and I've noticed that there's a back windshield
like leak happening in my truck on the corner.
I saw a little like crack, not on the glass itself, but that connects the car
and the glass together.
Is there any like, I read something about possibly being like a warranty on the
back windshield for Ram?
Is there any warranty for that?
So as far as recalls, I don't think so, but I can still grab your van
and look it up and double check.
But for the most part, it's a failure that we see often, and it ends
either being the third brake light, or like you said, what you're experiencing
now, the seal between the back glass and the cab itself.
Yeah, I've done the third brake light, and I even just brake water
not on the third brake light, only the corner in it was going in.
Yeah, so like it's probably that, not the third brake light.
Yeah, well let me pull this up here.
Do you have your van handy or have we seen it before?
Yeah, I could read it off right now.
Yeah, I just need the last eight.
Last eight.
Okay, it's a an seven zero zero four nine one.
And that's a is an alpha and is a Nancy.
What was that?
The first two is an alpha and is a Nancy or Emma the Mary.
So the first two is.
Hey, as in a kite.
And then and as in.
I don't know why I can't even end like night, night time.
Yep, yep, okay.
Oh, recall relating to that back window.
Okay.
And the only warranties left are her emissions warranty.
Okay.
So there's no warranty on this back glass.
Okay, if there if there is like the crack non the glass itself that like the maybe the bottom of the ceiling or whatever is that something you would have to like replace the entire window for probably.
And we do it all know here.
I see them reseal them.
Okay, now I don't know if they're sealing just over the crack that they see or if they're taking the whole window off cleaning it resealing the whole window.
I'm not sure.
Okay.
Is there any idea on like a range of how much maybe it costs or maybe.
Like any at all.
Yeah, so let me get you with one or I'll get with one of the main advisors and that you have to give you a call or I will give you a call back and making kind of figure out a cost and exactly what the procedure is.
Um, is this the best one I'm going to reach out.
Uh, Kyler.
Why L.A.R.
Nothing.
I will leave some notes and either I or someone will call you back.
Perfect. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
