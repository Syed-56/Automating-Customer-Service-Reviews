That's Lithia Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Yuba City for English, please press 1.
Para esvenio, preción e dos.
Thank you for calling the service department and jump.
Thank you for choosing Yuba City Dodge Service Center.
This is Cheyenne.
I can help you.
Yeah, I brought a brand new Dodge truck from you guys about two years ago, a year and a half
ago.
And I bought the warranty for like last coverage and it had the full security package and all
that stuff.
I had the channel number four.
I was in T-shirt.
My window got broken.
My back window.
I wasn't too sure if that was covered under that extra package that I bought for the repairs
and stuff like that in security system.
Oh, gotcha.
Okay.
So I don't have warranty information on my side.
Let me see if I have an advisor here.
Is this for a 24 RAM, 2500 for coal?
That's right.
Okay.
Take a look.
Usually windows are not covered.
But let me just see if I have an advisor here to clarify.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Now it looks like all my advisors are currently with guests.
Cole, I can take down your phone and birds and message over and have them give you a call.
Yeah.
One, and it's for the rear window, the very, very fast at the cab.
I will.
I do.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
I do remember purchasing coverage where if I get a crack in my window that you guys will
replace it for free.
I do remember having that coverage and then having the full security system.
So I was just curious if I would cover all the windows or just the front one.
So.
God.
Okay.
I think that might just be for the windshield.
But again, I'd want an advisor to call you back to verify that.
Sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.
Okay.
Are you a welcome call?
Don't give you a call.
Okay.
Sounds good.
Bye bye.
Thank you.
Have a great day.
Bye bye.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
