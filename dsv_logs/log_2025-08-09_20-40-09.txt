Thank you for calling Chris for all of this Mike speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?
Hi, my name is Titus. How are you?
Good. How can I assist you?
Mike, if the manager there?
I have several managers. What's its regarding?
Well, I bought a car, a used car, and 23 from a gentleman that I wanted him to.
I want the finances to work. But I almost, you guys, have the record go back that forth because I don't remember the first question name.
But he was really great and I have a sister that lived in Midland.
And I'm thinking she's coming down to look for a car here.
I think she's making these and she thinks she's in the ball.
So I feel like she's this dealership because of the quality of excellence that you guys provide us with me in the way you guys know me.
And this is possible. So I could win any work of other than for work. I couldn't with the Dallas I could win with the auto bond.
But I'm choosing you guys because of that idea right there.
So I'm trying to figure out what was your phone number when you bought your car.
I'm going to see if it's in the system.
Okay.
Got it here.
Burnt. Got you right here. Okay.
You know, you you dealt with the lock lock is still here, but he's in the business office.
He doesn't do the sales.
But yeah, he is here when he can.
I could help but when she comes in and then we can make sure a lot of capture in the business office.
That's where you do all the paperwork and everything.
Well, what I'm trying to find out.
So is there I want to get there's a particular car that she's looking for and you guys don't have it. Can you find it for?
Is it a new one?
Yeah, she's looking for a new one. Yes.
Yeah, what what vehicle is she looking for?
She's even the nine.
I have a four year she's looking at the nine.

I mean, we do have a like I think she's looking for like a I think a silver one.
Yeah, well, the new ones are Aurora silver.
The 25 but yeah, I have plenty. Let me just pull up my XC 90.
So I'm just I don't know if she.
I have to find it. She looking for the 25 of the 26.
Yeah, but since this is in my big real on this run, but I don't know.
Because it's a couple of years looking at the little congee, you know, and she's looking at.
Are you able to pull on it?
But I'm trying to persuade her to go over this direction.
Yeah, well, if she.
Midway through 25 we did have refresh on it.
So 25.5 and above you'll have the.
New grill and then I do have some 25 that would be the old grill.
So she likes the new grill you said.
No, she doesn't like the new grill.
Oh, yeah, then shoe that would be it.
We've had to go with the 25.
You email me from some pictures on the other.
What's that that we can do back in the queue?
Yeah.
Well, I could just ask you just get you out of your website and work with you.
You just go to you click on it and then you go to new cars.
And then on the left you just go to vehicles.
For XE 90s you'll pick the model XE 90 and then, you know, you can go to 25 miles.
So you'll have 25.5s and some 25s.
25s will be the old grill of the 25.5.
But yeah, I can send you a link right now.
And then you can just you just click on it and then go to XE 90s and then you can pull up all the XE 90s.
We have available.
