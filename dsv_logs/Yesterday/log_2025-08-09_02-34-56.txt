Take a second and I'll hand it.
Here I got a card from the somebody who is Sean.
Just one second.
Let me find out what's your name, by the way.
My name is Juan.
Juan and you're from which dealership?
Yeah, I'm the one that actually call you Mr. Sean Pro.
Yep.
You have one where it goes.
Yes, right, sir.
That's right.
Which is kind of how you got the, yeah, you were, we already, I don't expect S E.
Yep.
Yep.
So, will you be able to come in today?
I think these both context, right?
You said you wouldn't be able to come any lower than some dollar, right?
I think I gave you another card that I was getting from another dealership for like
290 or 250 years.
Looking something around 250, you said you cannot do that to come not wrong.
Yeah, even, even to 90, we cannot do too many.
The team has got three, three twings.
The rupees, what I have.
So we see 20 dollars you have.
Let me go ahead and see how they're for right here.
I run it the other day.
Yeah, you see 20 dollars, the best you can do.
You're looking for a 21 and that's with zero money out of your pocket.
And that's based in the county.
If it's a friend, this is going to change.
I hear the base on Orange County.
How much of the same is in LA?
LA?
How about from 3.0, you want to accept my job to like 3.49?
Okay.
No, I'm an artist completely encouraged.
Yeah, so you're good.
There will be 21 and 50 cents.
Yeah, if you would like to be in the 250, we don't have a card that's going to work
in the 250 for the EV though.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll rate one to be honest with you.
I don't have much of that.
Somewhere late until I come closer to the number.
I don't know if you could tell you that the really
you're going away.
September 1st?
No, I know that.
I know.
I know.
September 5th.
I'm not giving you by the way.
I'm not giving you $7500 for me to make this team.
I'm giving you $2,250.
I'm not giving you $250.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I hear you.
I hear you.
But that's the number that I can't work with at this point.
I don't have that budget.
It means because I got to spend like 5 grand
or upgrading my electrical panels.
So I have to work with some numbers that work for me.
So as 320 is not going to cut it for sure.
And as I'm telling you, there are two more dealers who are coming to
to turn to the flu 90 for me.
And once you want to beat them, I don't think I can come over.
One.
I'll be honest with you.
Yeah.
I understand.
So if you have something already for that number, all I have to do is
say thank you so much for giving me the opportunity.
But I cannot come.
I cannot come that to the most.
Okay.
But even if I go to my box, it's going to be an hour of $10.
So it'll be like $11.
But that's what I mean.
Every thing already is also ready on.
I give you every single really that is available.
There's no more.
Sure.
No, no.
No idea.
You are here.
I'm standing there.
So like, I know.
I know.
I know.
I mean, you're doing what you can.
I completely understand.
But I do have other competitive offers.
So I'll wait to see what comes out best from there.
But I was just going to ask you, do you guys do?
I think you have joined eyes.
But I know you are concerned of TR.
So do you have a TR dealership by you?
Like, I think one of the key ideas is of lower costs compared to the ionic.
Do you also have a partnership with fear?
Unfortunately, in our third.
No, not in our hand.
Okay.
We are just our stores within all the sisters store Honda.
Honda, the home.
But if you want key, I believe key.
The key I fear and give the range that we give you.
You know, the less ranges like that.
Right.
I'm giving you the 220 range.
I'm giving you the 300 plus range too.
So I'm not trying to give you the other one because nobody has it.
You know, like the 220 range or SE, you know, like the short range.
Nobody has it.
So if it was out, yeah, I would have been probably a bit better for you, but nobody has one.
So.
This is, this one, like your 14, 3, 11.
You're the 300, 11, 14, is it SE, yeah, or is it SE standard?
Which one is that?
This is a SE with a long range.
No range, right?
Yeah, that is okay.
Okay.
Just to be clear, yeah.
SE with a long range.
Sorry, it's called it.
Okay.
Called long range, yeah.
300, right?
300 or 300, 10 range.
I know that, yeah.
Okay, one.
I like you know it.
I'll call you back.
I have your number.
I think I have it here.
So I can reach you back.
But at this point, I'm going to just wait for a little more one.
Okay.
I'm learning, you know, I mean, there's a lot of money in the state.
We remember it ago and we were waiting.
So those we were here.
Yeah, yeah.
That's fine.
That's fine.
You want me?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sorry, you want.
I cannot work for that number.
It doesn't work.
It doesn't help my.
If you really have a two-90, I mean, I'm asking you, why do you not going to go through it?
What's that, Sydney?
If you really have a two-90, if you really have a two-90 deal, I am going to them.
I'm going to them.
Yeah, I'm going to tomorrow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So if you're there and you'd be like, oh, one, it was two-90 plus taxes.
It can come out more.
Because that's what they're going to throw you.
It's going to be like, oh, yeah, yeah.
It's going to be like, oh, yeah, yeah.
It's done.
I know.
Two-90 people.
I have, I have, no, no, no.
I got that all clarified.
I have all that in writing and beginning.
I'm going to call this a drywall stack.
Everything included, that's the number that we have in me.
And if they are going to stick to that number,
otherwise I'm walking out.
I'm not going to buy this.
Right?
I'm not going to do this my time.
I'm not going to stick.
I'm going to go in.
I'm going to do that.
Yeah.
I mean, if you're working more on a two-90 or two-90 plus that.
Yeah, yeah.
No.
I will.
I will.
For sure.
Yeah.
If that doesn't work, I mean, I'm just letting you want to get.
If you have, if it's things that can come down to 300,
probably I'll definitely consider them.
If they do that to me, even I go there and they get six on me.
And if they don't know, they set to 90 and collect back.
So it's going to be like three, 10 now.
I would rather bring the business for you.
So maybe a three plus that is going to come like the three, 24 and change.
So that's exactly what I have.
Yeah.
I have three, 21, eight, two, or taxes.
Yeah.
Between you and your taxes.
Yeah.
You can come down.
You can come down to three, 10, 11 is what you're thinking.
That's the best thing to do, right?
I say, if that's what you're going to take for me to make the deal,
but two-90 are handled here.
But the one that they told me is two-90.
And then when you go to be like, oh, it's going to be two-90 plus tax.
Yeah.
So that's the example of the three, 27.
Yeah.
Not pulling.
I have better here than there are.
And the two.
And the two.
The one.
Yeah.
If that's the case, I will call you right.
I'm not going to bring the two down because there have not been on a city.
Okay.
Right.
Right.
Where was that?
Trust it.
And one.
You know?
We sure was our one.
We sure was our one.
Trustee?
Are there a couple of downsides to Labuna and all?
So I'll see what they're doing.
They're two to three of them who are saying the same numbers to me.
And you have any incentives to them.
Like any charge.
It's really considered to make you consider like,
is there offering these $400?
I think $500 up the price point.
And then the charge will do.
That after all, I can only offer you whatever's online.
That's it.
What's that?
Is it trying to make these up?
That's the same thing on the end.
And I do that.
Whatever shows and how that you are saying,
that's what we're getting easier.
And that's it.
You know, we're not going to make it.
What's that?
Can you tell me what is that when you do it for your customers?
I just walk away from my computer.
You know, I'm here right now, my phone.
But now that we've contacted me,
take me, take me that.
Can you go back?
You can take me that.
Whatever is that incentive is that you get from home to online,
USA.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
And you just,
let me just text me.
Yeah.
Okay, you guys.
Okay, all right.
Thank you, buddy.
Okay.
Bye.
