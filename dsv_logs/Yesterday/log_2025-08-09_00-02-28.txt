==== NEW TRANSCRIPT ====
Transcript:
I'm so excited about that.
Thank God this answer can you call back.
Hey, how are you?
I'm pretty good at myself.
Fantastic.
Hey, I was just, I was reaching out.
I'm over here at Cross Report.
I'm pretty.
No.
Just Ian, if you're still in the market for a new raptor.
Oh, I think I'm getting a, I'm going to actually wait.
I'm going to pull the trigger on the mark.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I'm going to wait without a little bit.
You have a market, you know, kind of settle team next couple of months.
And then other part of the comments.
Bring on.
Because I want to see how, how they kind of do price rise on the,
you know, the key or extra.
Yeah.
I feel that.
I get that.
Yeah.
It's kind of a crazy market on those, you know, and I just, I wonder if they're going to go,
down in price or if we're going to do something crazy and like, you know,
change something about them to try to see your item.
That's what I mean.
I'm in the couple of different forms.
No, someone that dies on there, one big once the new TRX drop on me has to go to trade my name.
I'm like, okay, I'm going to go buy yours.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just trading your trading your years with like, 2700 miles on it.
So I can go buy it for way.
Yes.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
I mean, that's pretty much what I ended up deciding.
I do like, you know, I like to 3700 times each, but the art is just, you know,
after listening to that interesting.
I wish I could drop it.
Somebody wants you to grab it.
Yeah.
They don't want to do anything.
We just sold our office showroom.
Two days ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yesterday we pulled in a black widow to put in a Spain spot and we pulled it right away as soon as
it came in the showroom, like within two hours someone came in and bought it.
So we're just moving through these specialty trucks like crazy.
We have a, we have a wanger rafter here now too.
And I guess those are super hard to find stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just, I don't know.
I need a fourth life show.
Another.
Yeah.
I wasn't saying we run the same thing.
No, I mean, I just say I saw it when he's like, you know, he's telling me,
I got me a rack or something.
Okay.
Nice.
Let me get some tape.
And he says they are very little.
It's kind of small for a rafter.
And then he got something outside of that over some reason.
Yeah.
I'm still having a wrap to motor in, you know, but it's kind of the same as a whole size.
Yeah.
Exactly.
So what I'll do too is I'll keep your info.
And then if I get like, if I get an orange, it's like gently used or something like that too,
do you want me to reach out to you?
Yeah.
Sure.
Definitely.
We've got some.
Yeah.
We got to get market on it.
Yeah.
That way if it's, if it's the timing of right, then I'll come in and pull the trigger on it.
Perfect.
Sound good.
I'll walk into your in the loop and then just keep us in the loop too as, as far as like, you know,
you're, once you're aggressively looking for one also, we don't have to do something for you.
Okay.
Don't give.
Alright.
No problem.
Fuck.
It's my.
