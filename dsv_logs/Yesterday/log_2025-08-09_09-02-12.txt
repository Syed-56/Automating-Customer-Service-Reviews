This call may be recorded.
Think of it using Can
the
information.
Thank you for holding.
I have Cody on the line for
the resist.
Thank you.
Hello there.
There's Cody and sales.
I hope you're.
Hey Cody, my name is Terry Edwards.
I'm looking at your website.
Actually looking into bunch of websites.
In the market for a four
month, come up with a
pretty small screen.
There's a really small screen.
You have a couple of
more coming.
Do you guys have any on the
lot or on the order that includes
the post-text package with the digital
ahead and double checks because they do always tell me the variety of different things.
As they come from factory, they do get a clip with some different technology.
Yeah, looking at the options on all of them and I'm just not seeing any forerunners
that you guys have that include that toe-tech and it just seems odd that none of them
have been ordered with it because it's the medium-y meter.
Yeah, pretty popular.
Yeah, I mean, they all come with toe-hitches and they come with the wiring and everything
so they're so trailers doing what you need to do.
Just get all of them are coming with that digital review mirror.
But let me get the right left for you and see what I have available.
A lot of these are pre-sold, but let's see what I have.
I've been driven the new forerunner yet.
I had learned, so the things start was toying with driving over the hill with a bigger selection
and more in stock, but thought I'd start locally.
Yeah, well, it looks like I actually have, oh, those are both cutting edge.
So you're looking for the underground color?
I wouldn't be opposed to the cutting edge.
I was kind of confusing that with kind of the cement color, the more of a matte amount of
into the Chinese silver.
Yeah, the underground is the shiny silver is cutting edge.
Yeah.
It's kind of like the wind, yeah, wind trail purl, the underground, and then kind of a backup option would be the cutting edge probably.
Understood.
Well, as of right now, I crazy enough I've never seen this happen because of how popular they've been.
I have a TRD off-road premium and it's here, the sport premium, both in stock, both cutting edge.
And let me see if they have the toe tech package on either of them.
Yeah, I'm on your website too.
I saw all those that say in stock, but I'm just not seeing any when you click on the vehicle.
And do you guys not post Windows stickers?
Typically Toyota doesn't post Windows stickers.
I haven't seen those.
That's more of like a domestic vehicle thing.
I've seen them a lot of boards and Chevy's.
That's weird.
Because like the pretty folks, yeah, the Springfield Toyota dealer post the Windows figure.
Ever since I've been here, they haven't been on there, but the Windows stickers are on the vehicles and you come on down, of course.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But yeah, it looks like actually a few of these in stock.
One is on the way.
Your should be here by tonight and the other one didn't land today.
So they both should be available for test driving either by probably first thing tomorrow or afternoon.
And do you see any of them with the toe tech?
I'm not.
I see them.
They have the premium package auto demean review mirror with the home.
Yeah.
I'm kind of hoping that by seeing kind of a general name of, you know, premium package, maybe it was tucked away in there.
But when I go to the Toyota website and actually build a unit, it does seem like that toe tech is a 400 or option.
So that's why I was just trying to go through all 16 of your guys's four runners and not the end with it.
Okay.
That was kind of weird.
Yeah.
I mean, that is a little odd.
I will.
I will definitely agree.
But a lot of people don't get these four runners for telling.
They typically buy them for their off road and capabilities or just.
Yeah.
And I wouldn't be using it for telling you.
I just really like that.
Did do the over every year.
That was the main reason I bought the toe tech, you know.
Got I understand.
Yeah.
Let me go ahead and just double check.
Let's see.
Yeah.
If you have the ability to put package.
Yeah.
So your D RV ability to search.
Just to see if anything by toe tech and nothing.
Yeah.
Let me see.
I just got to find the code for our toe tech package to see if any of my four runners potentially have one.
two two two two two.
Because I'm on our main piece compared to being on the website.
And I.
So when is that sale pending does that mean he's just taking it to the positive or what?
Just or if you definitely do.
Yeah.
When still pending, I mean, there's a deposit on the vehicles of the vehicle.
It's technically off the market until that person makes their choice of buying the vehicle or not.
So I'm simply still pending vehicles are not always here.
Right now what I have selected is available.
But if I were to go ahead and minus what is currently sold.
In my inventory right now, nothing is sold.
But I do have some other Tierdie sport premiums like in that windshield pearl that are pending until they come in here.
Mm hmm.
So what do you have?
I know you're still looking at the toe tech thing.
But do you have in stock currently?
You said you have a one sport premium and one off-road premium both in.
Two.
Yeah, I have two SR five.
I have one off-road premium one sport premium.
And it looks like I actually have another sport premium landing, but it is a black on black.
Yeah.
I'm seeing one unit.
It says black on black.
It says in stock.
Yeah.
So I remember X four seven five six one.
Yes, that's it.
Maybe that one came in.
So you technically have that first row on your website.
Look to all be a stock.
Yeah, I have everything except for the Tierdie off-road.
It still gives me a purple status, which purple means it's on the truck to the dealer as we speak.
The other ones are all new to that are on ground as of today.
Hmm.
Well, I guess regardless, you have one to test your eyes even if it's not fully equipped.
Exactly.
And then what's the process for actually ordering one?
What's the weight if I wanted to order one that was fully equipped?
Yeah.
So typical waste time to go and have one of these ordered is an average of three to six months,
depending on the package and a combination that you're looking for.
The other specific you are on it and the more in details on everything,
it does take a little bit longer to try and do the whole one.
Good toy that is not an order company.
We try a preference them out and try and get a hold of one that's going to be as like yours.
Or sometimes we get them right on the money.
But since it is such a large company, it's kind of harder to do.
Anyway, moving forward with it.
It is a thousand dollar deposit.
We can take that via cash card, check however you want to do.
We preference out the order that you want.
We kind of take your top three colors, some accessories, and some of the packages that you're looking for.
So it's like you wanted to take package.
We'll put that in the preference.
We need one with one.
And then it becomes in any of your top three colors with other things that you were looking for.
Then we let you know, hey, we got a hold of one.
Is this one look like it's going to match everything you want.
And then we put your name on it and tell it arrives here at our dealership.
Okay.
I guess lost my turn.
Oh, and then how do you guys work?
Do you do de-restriers?
Because you guys are a kind of dealer versus some of the other sort of lithium.
So do you do de-restriers?
Yes, we do.
And depending on what you're looking for, someone else has it.
We can always try to get one.
Those are becoming a little trickier to do all these forerunners because once people have a hold of them and we'll have a stock of them.
They don't want to give them up unless we're giving them the exact trade-off, maybe a different color.
That means a typical row around on it.
I can't say it's not impossible.
And then I guess my last question would be, I'm only seeing like SR5s and sport premiums and off-road premiums.
So do you not have any limited, there are platinum, there are any other models ordered?
As of right now throughout everything I've seen, almost no dealerships that we know have ever seen, they're limited or platinum, except for maybe one or two this entire year.
I know for a fact that we've only received one limited this entire year and we have not received a platinum at all.
Sure.
Because they're not making, they're just using the point space to crank out all these popular models of things.
Exactly. They're cranking out all the ones that they know that the public is going to want more now.
And they're not making as many of the others until there's a bit of a higher demand or once the flush out of these go through.
Okay. And then I lied. I have a couple other questions.
So from a final standpoint, you guys have any incentives.
See some of these are marked down just a little bit.
But do you have any interest, any tutorial running any incentives on interest rate or anything?
We are and it does change on a monthly right now. It's currently on the Tacoma, the tundra and the rap four.
So we don't know what's going to be changing in the further months.
But since the four runners such a new vehicle kind of like the new rap four coming out, there are no current incentives on these vehicles.
That thing we're not here to not make you a great deal because we will do what it takes to make you a great deal. We're open to reasonable offers.
And we do work with 40 local lenders.
So we end up finding a more aggressive rate through someone else depending on how you want to go.
and we always check out those as well.
Okay. And then so the ones I'm seeing it looks like you do have discounts on the five that you haven't stopped.
Just small and five on the bus.
Okay.
All right. Well, the chances of you selling all five, I would like to have dry one.
So what are your guys' hours tomorrow?
Tomorrow we are going to be open from nine, seven.
And I will be here all day. My name is Cody.
And what I can do for you is I'm going to shoot you over a text with my information.
If this is a good number to text back on, and do name.
Actually, let me give you my personal phone. I'm calling you from my work cell.
So I got to use the personal protecting. Let me give you.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
And that's your any two eight seven is your work phone. Is that correct?
Correct. That's my work.
Yeah.
Okay.
Copy that. Let me put that down.
I just have better reception on it.
It's a iPhone versus a smart phone on my personal.
I just have better.
Better reception.
They're both for writing.
But for some reason my work cell has better connectivity.
Right.
I, you know what? I understand that.
It looks like I have you in our system that you maybe talked with us before in the past.
I came in a long time ago.
And but yeah, I came in a long time ago.
Look at it.
Tundra.
One of the ones you kind of tricked out.
And but we realized it wouldn't fit in the standard garage.
So that was about the only.
Got you.
Okay.
I came by a long time ago.
Okay.
Well, I got you in my system, which makes it nice and easy.
So go ahead and shoot a text over to the one.
Three then.
Okay.
Yep.
Got to work.
All right.
I'm going to shoot you over my information.
Oh, hang on one second.
Let's see.
Perfect.
I'm just going to say, hey, it's go to you over at Kendall Toyota.
You can text me on this number.
Or if you need to hold me, I can shoot you over my direct line.
So that would be a call only number.
You know, around what time would be best for you to come on down tomorrow.
I don't.
I'm guessing it would probably be late morning.
Uh, lunchtime ish probably.
Yeah.
Copy that.
I will go ahead and put you down for.
Oh, no.
I kind of guess around 12.
And if you're not here by 12, I'll just go ahead and give you a ring.
Yeah, I can shoot you a text too.
If I'm hit that way.
Yeah, that would work absolutely perfect.
Like I said, I got a couple of four runners here on the ground.
Love for you to check them on now.
They, uh, everything should be ready for full test driving tomorrow morning.
And if anything does change, don't hesitate to read down.
Give me a phone call or shoot me over at text.

All right.
