Great bye and how are the sales? This is Michael. How can I help you today?
Hi Michael. I'm trying to get in touch with your internet sales manager.
We actually don't have one. We kind of just all know that it's turned away.
Everything is out of our corporate office in Oregon.
So they kind of, yeah, they set it up and we, all the sales people, just manage and get to the lead.
Alright sounds good. So your name is Michael. Michael Hinsley, yes sir.
And we are available more years on everything.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We have people that help us.
So yeah, we handle everything.
Alright, no problem terrific. My name is David Hernandez and I'm interested in buying a vehicle from you.
Okay. Okay, what should I be looking for?
I'm looking at your stock number.
Tango hotel.
Five, but one.
So I was getting to the system. So we got.
No, sorry.
Sorry.
T.
H.
Yeah.
T.
H.
Five.
One.
Six.
Four nine.
Okay.
I look like I have a Honda Civic Sport.
I'm just going to get some kind. So let me.
Verify the availability of this vehicle because like I said,
good check is we've been trying to level these cars if they're in transit to let people know that they will be here.
So maybe you know, I would.
Absolutely appreciate you doing this and I've got the story to tell you.
Oh, I was going to imagine that.
I've been to for just a long time and I try to respect people's time.
So well, well, in the in the I got another story to tell you about that one.
But that's the reason I'm calling you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just yeah.
And I mean you personally, but that's why I'm.
I'm not that.
So you made down the road.
You may don't.
Yeah, you do business together.
So okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let me check that.
Okay.
All right.
So it shows to be available.
It's only three days old.
Let me say five drops.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
The black on black.
Sports sedan.
We'll make sure I got a link.
Correct.
Okay.
All right.
What do we got?
Sure.
All right.
So.
I just trying to be real honest and I'm sorry if I found frustrated.
But I kind of am.
I would say when are competitors this morning?
And I'll just be again.
I don't want to waste your time or mind.
And I was hoping that the guy this morning wasn't going to waste my time.
But that didn't work out.
What ended up happening was I have a actually have a written off already from a dealership.
And I'll try to 28,000 out the door on this thing.
So I'm going to true car.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm listening to you guys 20 or okay.
Yeah.
On this particular model.
I ended up going on true car and that was kind of in the state.
Because true car you click on a button and all of a sudden you start getting phone calls from other dealers.
Yeah.
They do require they require the information.
Yes, sir.
They do.
Yeah.
It didn't know that.
So then all of a sudden I started getting phone calls.
And just I thought I was just browsing cars just saying hey, is this, you know, good price
kind of thing?
Long storage.
And I get a deal where the calls me up and says hey, I can beat that by a thousand bucks.
Come on in and I asked him.
I said well, I have a written off or I need you to put it around because again, I don't
want to drive down somewhere.
He's like well, no, no, we don't do that.
Just come on in.
You can trust me blah, blah, blah, blah.
So I went to this guy this morning and ready to close the deal.
You know, it's 27 on this car.
He then comes back and says oh well, then once it's starting to go shooting.
And then it turns into it's not ready.
So before we keep going in and I'm just going to, you know, I would rather pay what I've got now
writing from folks than, you know, than not have anything in write.
And also I have my question to you because I know certain companies are not like this.
If you and I can come to an agreement on this thing, I can be in your office with an
apply six o'clock tonight to pick up the vehicle.
But I won't go down there and was a guy thing's in writing.
I know I'm not waiting for that.
Like I did this morning with these other guys.
And then I didn't have the vehicle in stock either even though they were telling me oh yeah.
So I appreciate you checking first of all.
Yeah.
Well, that's what I said.
I've been we've been dealing shortage of service and we still are.
So that's why I wanted to make sure.
No, I appreciate it.
And it was so weird though is it's not a this is the other issue.
They're all over the place.
I mean seriously, I mean there's 15, 20, hundred dealers in the DFW area.
And that's what I'm saying.
I was very surprised that they didn't have this one, right?
Because again, it's it's just the hottest.
It's kind of a clarin or a Porsche or being in the.
I don't know.
It's a shock to us because I mean we actually had to buy a course out of state.
to get them here to Texas.
So yeah.
Yeah.
And just you know this is this is for me.
It's for my kid actually.
He's going to school.
He's getting his first car kind of thing.
So there's you go in a high school or college.
No, no, you're going to college and stuff.
So that's why I'm in.
Honestly, that's why I was ready to pull the trigger this morning.
I was down at the dealership.
They screwed with me.
I didn't put it.
I didn't force them to put it in the right.
So that's why I wanted to clarify that.
No hard feelings.
If you tell me now that you can't put.
things in writing and send it to me in this and that way before I go down there.
I know I'm not going to waste my time like I did this morning.
Yeah.
No, I got your time.
Okay.
Gotcha.
I'm not here to say no to them here to see what we can figure out.
So I mean I appreciate you telling me everything.
So we can just you know as all saying cut right to the BS.
Let's get to it.
Exactly.
Okay.
Exactly.
I need to know that you can be a problem.
I need to know this was a 20.
Okay.
So as we've been up front with me, I'm real from with you.
I really, for me to even get close at offer and because a lot of times I can get these guys to match it.
So is there any way you can provide me that offer?
Which one?
The one I already got.
Yeah.
Hold on.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hold on.
I'm looking for 20 cents.
I already told you where I was right with 28.
Now I'm going to send this to you.
Okay.
Okay.
That's where is that.
If you come back to me, like, oh, I'm not going to 100.
No.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
No.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm just 28.
That's what I said when you're sitting 28.
You know, I mean I'll try and get it.
But like I said, 28.
When you said that I was 18.
I'm definitely going to have to go ask for some permission on that one.
Well, then that's going to be disrespectful to you.
Then let me talk to the guys who's making the decision.
If it's the sales manager again.
And then I work.
I can do that.
Talk to you.
I can do that.
Talk to you.
Let me get your phone number.
And I'll have him.
So I won't go to him and directly.
Yeah.
So what's your phone number?
Okay.
And then I'll have to do a phone number.
Actually, this one is my cell phone.
It's, um, do you want to show them a?
1570?
Okay.
Yeah.
And again, I'm just trying to, I apologize to you.
If I'm coming across a little aggressive, it's just having to go through that.
And then now it's like, oh, well, again, I'd, I would rather honestly go with what I've
got right now for a hundred bucks, 200 bucks, and not have to deal with the headaches
because I got it in a writing.
I don't have to do it anymore.
Who I don't have to drive anywhere.
It's, you know what I'm saying, even if there's so how far, how far away from you from us?
I'm actually in Fort Worth.
I mean, color.
Okay.
Okay.
Third.
Third.
So no, I mean, I used to work.
I used to work down there.
It's, you know, and to be honest, I'm just saying and the offer I got is from Honda Fort Worth
just down the road for me.
That's why I'm like, you know what?
Good.
Not deal with that's the written one.
Right.
And I'm looking at it right now, 28,300 is what they gave me.
Very 28,300 out the door.
Right.
I'll just say that is your thing about.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then I'll go.
I'm just surprised there are clothes, we are.
That's why I was asking.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You know, I'm just up on 35W and you're a blind parkway up there.
So it, I get on 35W and drive a couple miles and I'm down, you know, maybe 10 miles or
whatever.
Okay, so I guess they probably got the highway cleaned up a little bit out there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the whole road is in
Okay, I haven't been out there in four years as well as ask him. I'm definitely not coming this direction
Yeah, okay
Sorry, you kind of know that
Well, I was gonna say so if you come back with you know, although we can maybe cut it 200 and I get your same
Aggressive I know you're supposed to say it's aggressive totally understand don't and I'm trying to be an asshole
They're just being there. Oh, okay. I just I just felt right. I sold 30. I saw more cars people buying a lot of money
I'm a month. So I see I know I see what the numbers are
Kind of right. Yeah, that's a pretty good price, but yeah, I can respect it. No problem. All right
So and I do apologize you when you kind of I didn't have anything to write on and my memories about
That's a squirrel give me a first-man again
