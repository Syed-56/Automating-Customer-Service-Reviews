Hello, this is Emma over at the Omega Tigers.
Hi, is this Ben?
It is, yeah.
Hey Ben, it's Lucas calling.
What's going on?
Hey, I just wanted to check in before tomorrow.
Make sure I have everything.
So, for...
So, if I go to Leasing Row, water some of this, or do I need to write you guys a check, or how
you guys take the down payment?
Yeah, so if you just put down kind of a minimum, which I think was like 2,550 bucks for the
drive-off, you know, we can take them on a credit card, debit card, personal checks, where
you prefer.
Okay.
And then if I was to put down like 10 or something for finance or more, how would you want to...
Yeah, so with that, you can do 2,500 on a credit card.
And then the rest would either need to be on a debit card, or a personal check.
Okay.
Got it.
Okay.
Yeah, if you decide to do like a debit card though, just keep in mind some lenders from banks.
Yeah, how about the head of time?
Yeah, so usually on the back of your debit card is a number you can call.
And just tell them, hey, you know, I'm pleased to limit that's on my card.
I'm going to make, you know, run by the card kind of a thing.
Yeah.
Either remove it some lenders or some banks will like ask you how much, but either way,
is going to be there is some communication.
But to be honest, it's easier to have a personal check.
That's probably going to be the easiest way.
So you don't run into any feedback when you try to run the debit card.
So we have to recommend the people.
Okay.
That sounds good.
Okay.
And then the far is insurance.
The stuff goes, I can get it.
Or I already, I just don't have it active, but I can get it set up for like that vehicle specifically on my
card.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you do that, that's totally fine.
You'll just want to make sure when you send it over to you that tomorrow is what is today
to aid.
So make sure it's active starting the night.
Yeah.
Or it's a matter.
But as long as it's active, when you drive the car off the lot, we're good.
Sometimes I don't know why this happens.
If I'm sure it's companies you call them up, you know, you register the car with your insurance.
And then it's like posted for two days later.
And we just need something stating that you haven't sure.
And you know, as of today.
So the one with this tomorrow's date or today's date you're good.
Okay.
Cool.
Okay.
And then I think that's pretty much it.
Right.
Yeah.
Do I, do you want me to bring anything for the Oregon registration?
I can bring like the, I could bring the registration from for my, my,
part for my elder vehicle that's registered in Oregon or, I don't know if that's helpful
or needed or.
What do you know what Jacob just walked over?
Hey, Jacob.
We already have his registration card for the other vehicle right in the deal.
I'll be right.
Is it time?
Probably.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Whatever you have, I would just bring it.
It's always better to have more than have.
So.
Yeah.
I knew we had a couple things in your file already.
I just couldn't remember exactly what.
Yeah.
You have that registration card that's active for your other vehicle.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's kind of how he's made this all work.
I think is that the D of D said, hey, he's got an active registration card with the other
vehicle with the, with the address of sisters.
Oh, Jacob, you have an help on me.
So.
Yeah.
We got looking at your registration renewal.
I'm sorry.
I could see here.
It's a Chevy pickup truck.
You have a 17.
Uh, previous expiration was 814 25.
New expiration.
18.
You.
You.
27.
I have the current one.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That would be off.
Yeah.
You could bring that.
Okay.
That's easy.
Yeah.
That's purpose.
Okay.
That's a good question.
Um, I had emailed you about the use option with 12,000 miles.
Um, is I, what, what does that actually do to, does it change to residual value?
Is, is that how that calculation works?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, when you exactly, when you change from the 10,000 off here to the 12,000 mile free, or changes
amount, so that's why the numbers changed at about $25 or so.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
And would you be able to check and see if, if, if we could do the 1200 with the, amongst with the 12,000?
I mean, is, is that something that we might get?
Yeah.
Okay.
Um, you know, we can look at that when you get here.
I'm not sure if you got my email or not.
Um, last night, but I was just kind of stating that, you know, it does change from 1200 to,
I think 1225, so it's, you know, like $25 or $25.
Um, and I would just give you a break or anything in the back of the night you might want.
So, in the summer, she has a full retail.
I would tell them, you know, hey, we can give this customer a 20% off or whatever, whatever,
the case might be on the panel on the product that you might be interested in.
So we're kind of at that six grand discount at the moment.
And that's, um, you know, it was kind of well for me to kind of get that far, but I wanted to keep the deal together.
So, you know, when you get here tomorrow, we can kind of look at it and see what we can do.
Um, but yeah, I mean, we'll work with you, of course.
And, you know, we'll make experience good for you.
Okay.
No, I appreciate that.
Okay.
Is there anything else that people usually get?
I'm not planning on really getting anything else to add on what is.
There are a couple things that people will get.
I mean, a lot of people will get recent protection.
You know, it all depends on the people that I keep in the car, right?
At the end of the lease.
Some people will buy warranties, so buy maintenance.
And it can typically be cheaper to buy that upfront.
It's a good deal.
But the BMW warranty maintenance already covers the food.
Yeah, yeah, you got four years, 50,000 miles.
So that's covered during the lease.
Again, it's just for people that have the intention to buy it out at the end of the lease.
They'll do that.
And then for maintenance, you got the 36, three year, 36,000 miles.
So yeah, you're good.
And of course, that goes if you end up just turning it in a security day.
But you can, like we talked about, you can always buy that stuff later as well.
If you choose for it.
So, you know, like a local BMW dealer, where you can call it that.
I can only can work with you on the price.
But a lot of other people also buy like a windshield protection.
So it's something that if you've got a rock shill for a crack,
you can get fixed or replaced depending on how bad the hit is.
A lot of people get that one, honestly, because it's, you know,
the windshield on these BMWs aren't cheap.
And it's the cost of the product is pretty much the cost of windshield.
And it's for, I can't really determine, but it's for a long time.
And if you keep the car for three years, and if you travel on my way,
it's depending on your gravel, you know, on the road where you're at,
you know, it would be beneficial probably to do that.
It's just an insurance policy that a windshield is pretty much what it is.
So a lot of people do get that because it is worth it.
And then there are some other stuff that, you know, financial talk you got over.
So, okay.
I think my car insurance already covers the windshield.
So, yeah, there are some of these would be like deductibles, though, with that.
So you might want to, when you get this car with your guys going insurance,
you want to make the app in that too to see what the domestic world is for windshield.
But just know that product is something that we do offer as well.
Okay.
Okay.
Thanks, good.
But yeah.
We're definitely looking forward to your arrival.
And if you can, just keep it supposed to the one-year ride,
and you know, we'll make sure you get picked up and brought you up.
Okay.
Okay.
Should I?
So when I, how should I set that up?
Just, you mentioned, Webster.
Um,
So, I mean, if you want, you can send over your itineraries to be kind of know exactly
like when you're going to be landing and then once a day on just text Jacob and you're saying,
oh, God, I landed, you know, I'll be at the gate, 15 minutes or whatever.
Or at the gate, you know, to the front area or whatever.
And then we'll send the list.
I mean, those guys, they hover around the airport as soon as I call it.
I mean, he'll be picked up within five minutes.
Yeah.
Okay.
It's super easy, super fast.
Cool.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
That's on.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
The teammate call or give Jacob a call if you have any other questions, but, uh, yeah, the
car will already go for you.
We're completely in the shirt.
And so we'll, uh, we'll get over in the delivery bay for you.
Uh, probably this evening and then, um, that way when you arrive, um, the trade to go for you.
Awesome.
Okay.
And then, um, for the, for the break, well, I guess we'll go through that then, but there's, uh,
like a 1200 mile break in three.
Right.
Yep.
Okay.
I'm so glad you did see that here.
Local BMW shared that the 12 hundred miles.
Um, and they'll do that service for yourself.
I'm done.
Okay.
Okay.
So, we have to.
Okay.
Okay.
It's not.
Yeah.
Thank you.
To hurry, though.
If you have any more questions, though.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.
All right.
My friend, my path is okay.
Okay.
Bye bye.
