Transcript:
my friend just said I was supposed to design a speaking.
We did.
He didn't.
He didn't.
He didn't.
He even came to say at our fed them.
Yes.
Are you going to let me call me about the round four?
Yeah.
So, that was my year.
Would you like to see today?
She's a variable.
Yeah, let me see.
Get in one second.
I'm going to go to the next page.
Hello Mr. Jim.
How are you doing?
Good sir. How are you?
Good.
What did you tell me about the sales you had going on there?
I couldn't quite hear you when the cars were gone by.
No, that's okay.
So right now we're offering up to $1,000 off on any new or pre-owned vehicles.
I've definitely seen my measures do more for people to have their
practice in the showroom and for our non-stop and less.
I'm talking about a huge car.
Yeah, that's the price for a new or pre-owned vehicle.
Yeah.
How are you thinking about?
I mean, like 2018?
Yeah.
Yes sir.
This is a pre-owned vehicle.
What do you mean by pre-owned?
Pre-owned?
Yes.
It's like somebody or three before we know the vehicle and they got traded in.
Okay.
Okay.
That's okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So what you said you mentioned $1,500?
You mentioned $500?
You can apply for a $5,000 off coupon on our website and our vehicles are applying for a
$2,000 off.
So you can't get both to $1,500?
If you apply for $500 off coupon, you will get the $500 off and then you can potentially
get more good counter as well.
It just kind of depends on what the vehicle qualified for as far as this counter.
Okay.
We may see Parker here.
We may be able to make a view on something here.
I mean, seriously.
I mean, yeah.
I've got people on the world.
I've got my, I've got just $2,000 for you to share to your children.
I've got 21 pictures.
I've got the same neon car.
Yeah.
We can, we can, we can get to.
And is it running?
Is it running?
Is it running?
Is it running?
Oh, yeah.
That's okay.
That's all.
That's all.
That's all.
Yeah.
That's all.
I mean, we've been the only owner for it.
We, we, we take care of it.
I mean,
the reason I want your rid of is, is a moment to get 14 miles to the end of the seat.
It's a cylinder car.
And now I'm supposed to get some vehicle.
We've got this one for quite a while.
Okay.
Yeah.
I mean, we were definitely about to get our eyes on it.
If you can just send those some pictures over.
I mean, I'm just saying here if, if you found something, I don't know what, you know, if I could get a thousand
off here and 500 off here and get so much amount of car, we may be in the ballpark of working something
out.
Right.
There's a wheel there's a way.
I mean, yeah.
So,
So,
So,
So,
the need of.
This is recently get traded in.
So, I'm just waiting on a to get through the inspection process because probably traded from the couple of days that we got.
Now, are you guys going to be okay with the vehicle being the black on black?
I don't know.
That's the only thing she's, you know, I, I'd have to use any pictures of it.
She has to do that.
I can do that.
I mean, if, if, if the, if the money side is something in our, our, our financial
we're in ballot, then, you know,
I'm like,
I'm like a rule anything out right now.
Right, right.
For the right.
Right.
I think.
If you can send pictures of the inside,
I'm also size of the car, the inside, you know, and, and what do you say the mileage was on it?
I think it was around 43,000 miles.
Okay.
Okay.
So,
you know,
I might go over anything out now.
I mean, you know,
if I can get in the new command and we all command and you can make your information.
I can save some money and like,
company leadership can,
can hold a little, little expansion.
I mean, maybe something else.
I don't know.
All right.
Yes, there.
And that's really what we try to work towards over here.
Um,
I will give you the salesperson,
see where our car is.
You find out the information on your car,
but, you know,
don't,
don't get any closer too much than you buy them at the cold.
I don't know.
You've got some pictures of it.
And I can see you.
You get me all the gist.
When you say to me,
Jim,
here's the final,
here's the final prize for you.
We're all the gist,
and the coupons I go through and I call the final and all that stuff.
And we say,
here's the bottom line.
And then I say,
you take yours as a mod sheet and you say,
here's what we can give you for the sheet,
then we're,
we're just about there, you know.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes, sir.
Well,
let me give you my self-person,
see,
um,
if the video,
I can go ahead and get some pictures of the vehicle sent over.
and we'll just see you across every jibbering.
And it's okay.
Yeah.
And I do first,
like you say,
we do for quite
or silver that do our first effect in short.
You know,
we'll see what,
you know,
if you can't get it,
you can't find it right now,
and then we'll just see why that.
But I don't want you to go out.
When I said to you,
I thought maybe you all might have a different option,
fan or something.
Hmm.
What's the name you're far out there?
You can't tell you what else.
Okay.
Yeah.
I thought maybe you may have another deeper shift.
A sister deeper shift on placement.
Yeah.
You have this car looking for,
but I don't want to tell you.
Right.
Right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's really the issue.
Cause there's been a couple of vehicles that come.
But you know,
it's already right there,
pushing your budget and then a set of sister stores,
which we will have to pay a transfer fee.
And then you wouldn't be able to qualify for any discount.
So that's where we're going to try to find you something that's here on the lot.
So you know where there's going to be a lot more wiggle room.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And, you know,
I understand.
So I have a couple of places.
I think it was in.
I don't recall what it was at some places.
I've never learned.
And they had my own or was really,
you know, here in Florence,
Florence,
and they had a couple of dealerships.
And they would call up the other places.
They were there.
We don't have them.
We do have them.
You know,
they had one or five.
I was going to get.
So when they got here,
the mollies who said rose like a brand new car.
And the way out of my budget,
they kind of told me what was going to be.
And gas now,
he was different totally.
You know,
so anyway.
Okay.
We have the zoopal.
She got going.
You ring them.
Timmy tissues.
You got my email, right?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
And we'll just play by and see what happens.
All right.
Sounds good.
Okay.
Thank you a lot.
Appreciate it.
All right.
No, no, no.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Thank you.
All right.
All right.
