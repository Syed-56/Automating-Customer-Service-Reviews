Thanks for calling me, Tarzanita.
Thanks for calling me, Tarzanita.
So, a question.
If you have any ideas, please call the phone.
I'm from Los Angeles, North Carolina.
I'm sorry, you're telling me, Tarzanita.
Can you hear me?
All right.
It is pretty choppy, but it's better.
Okay, let me get closer to the lower box.
I apologize.
I'm not sure.
And I'm not sure.
No part, but I thought that you have a benefit in luck at $2,000.
Thank you.
Okay, for, uh, which solar?
I think the one in the first one is California.
This is the call center, but I can directly to a solar person there.
Can I have your name on the phone?
My name is David, and that's like two sun arrows on the face.
Perfect.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yes, I'm glad to see you.
I appreciate that.
Let me see the black image.
Hello, this is David La Maisner.
This is David for David, either way.
Yes.
Is this La Maisner two sun arrows on it?
Yes, sir.
You sure to have on mine shows that you have a ticket 24 foot.
On our feet in line.
I have a question.
I have a question.
You see that 24 foot still available?
Should we have any more?
I just want to make sure I need to reveal.
I'm sorry, we can mark it last.
I think it's life by second after show.
I can give it a stock number.
You need to fill it on right.
Okay, so the 24.1.
Yes, sir.
Yes, 24.1.
24.1.
25 foot just 94,000.
Yes.
Now, it says class A. Do you have to have a class A driver's license?
Drive that off the lot or is it still because it's under 24 feet still covered.
Okay, with a regular license.
Oh, so as you're reflecting this, even on a 40 foot RB, you've got data regular devices.
Class A means it's the type of units they are.
Like you've got class C, class B, class A.
Those are just how they classify RVs.
But you will need a regular driver's license.
I want to buy that Vegas from here like that.
And you guys take ACH checks from Texas.
I have a private assistant that I'm going to make a private.
You guys do a lot of titles.
I'll turn it back to Texas.
That's okay.
But I would like to purchase that from you.
Okay, I'm sorry.
You've got pretty bad in staying alive as a company.
Well, now it's going to be for myself to try.
But I think I have a state and a trust.
So it's going to be about to be.
You want to put it in it.
Okay, you just want to put it in the trust.
Okay, I'm going to buy it.
Okay, am I giving you an ACH check, pay it all out and it's going to the trust.
Okay, I can get a load of your title.
And a load of your title.
What type of title there?
It's called the Nolodio, a L-L-I-D-O-A-L.
A load of your title.
Okay.
Yeah.
I can put that in.
Yeah.
Correct.
And I like to have that.
Okay.
And we have that from a hurt one.
Yeah.
It's part to trust in the state.
So it's not a common thing.
But for the state and for the trust, I'm looking for the Lodio title.
Either way, regardless, I want to buy it.
If you can't get a hold of it because I can do it back and I get the Texas.
I'll get rid of this.
So I want to go ahead and buy that with an ACH check for you.
We'll take a trash off the door.
That's okay.
Okay.
Even off the wire money too, if you want.
I can do the ACH because the card does not sure it's required.
I mean, I can't wear it, but I do not think it's easy.
Oh, sorry.
Okay.
First of all, do you have any questions on it, sir?
You know, just one minute.
No, no, man.
I can't tell you how much I've found through over the things from bands and everything.
I could, I mean, when I get there, please give me the educational walkthrough.
But as for breaking it down and all that.
No, bro, I can tell you about it.
Yeah, a positive school is right.
That means couldn't be a set up beginning with.
I love everything.

We do have a 995 documentation and delivery fee.
Was that means we'll get here.
We're going to spend about three hours.
We're going to do all your paperwork.
We're going to spend about three, four hours if you go into the whole coach with you.
And since you've contacted some more to work in the midnight here, if you want to,
what is a nice takeaway that is across the street?
That leaves us one of the things that we're seeing function or if you have any other questions.
We can take care of it.

Absolutely.
No, I, I can't put in that.
I'm looking forward to it.
I'll, I'll send any of you.
Okay.
Okay.
So,
so what I need to start with people,
what I need to do is I have you sending a picture.
