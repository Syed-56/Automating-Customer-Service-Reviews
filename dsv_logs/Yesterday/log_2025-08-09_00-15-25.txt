for service, and fair pricing on every vehicle he sold.

Thanks, call Mr. Fittany of Bloom since the department of the staff are going to help
today.
What are you doing?
Hey, I bought a 2024 pad binder there.
I think in January 1st, I see you have a platinum edition.
I just got the S-B premium or whatever.
It's that 4 of green P9-2-3-6.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, the green Nissan.
Yep, yep.
Yeah, I was wondering if I could come back, what the difference would be if I swap
out the one I just got a few months ago for it.
Well, to be really honest with you, I'd love to look at things I decide.
Do you locally here?
We're up in Duluth.
Oh, I can't show.
Yeah, we've bought it from you.
I mean, it's probably it's been garage kept.
So...
Who am I talking to?
Yeah, I'm in the Dan Hill.
Oh, okay, Dan.
Dan, give me your phone number.
I'll look you up.
429.
Do you know how many miles around the Urig now?
I think it's like 14,000 maybe.
14k.
Okay.
I don't add it damages or anything like that.
Dan?
No.
No.
Beautiful.
A little crazy rate this second.
Do you mind if I start working on that and make sure I got you at the system?
Hell, Dan.
Yeah, I wish I would have known this one was coming up because I think it's even cheaper
than what we've had.
Yeah, we've just kind of been held on it at the beginning.
So there's not any room to move on that one.
We're trying to dump it.
Yeah, that's fine.
That's fine.
I just wanted to take that one and I'll just bring my other one down and pay the difference.
Let me go to work on this.
They haven't heard back from me by the morning.
Shook my tree a little bit, eh?
Yeah, we'll do.
Yeah, good job.
Yeah, if you could get it with, you know, I don't know.
I'm sure I'm going to pay tax and title and all that shift too often.
Yeah, we'll put everything in there for you.
A little send you an email with a quote and everything.
Thank you.
I'm pretty good.
Dr. Zenden.
Bye.
