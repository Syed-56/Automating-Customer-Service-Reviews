Hey, David. This is Vanessa.
When the manager is here, I forward.
How are you today?
I'm doing okay, Mr. Nitza.
Awesome. Awesome.
I know that you're working, Mr. Alex.
And I just like to just note,
any status that you were wanting to go to a different dealership?
I am. I asked you to get off the work.
I'm going over there. I'm excited.
Where do you wish you were going to?
I'm going to automation here in Corpus.
Okay. And I'm going to buy the name of Henry.
Will be assisting me.
Oh, that's nice.
So you're wanting to upgrade your Ford S3 50 Laureate.
I don't necessarily need to upgrade,
but I will be in another vehicle.
Okay. For some reason, it shows that you were trying to trade in your vehicle.
Well, I know that's my point,
but I don't know if it's going to be enough great for my vehicle.
I got a Larry.
I know. Just like upgrade because it's a 2019 and you're wanting to get a 2025.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm going to do that.
Okay. And what was the reason that you were wanting to continue to do business with us?
Because I spoke to one of your managers and very bluntly,
he said,
very bluntly, he said,
this is what I'm going to do.
So I'm going to say,
okay, well, that's going to work.
And then he says,
and I said, well,
what are you going to take off from the truck from the,
from the spiccup price?
He could update 2000 off.
I said, well, thank you very much.
That's all I need to know.
I'm not going to do the deal.
So he said,
I'm going to do no problem.
So that was it.
So I think I think we mutually agree that it wasn't going to go work out for it.
Is it because we couldn't get to the outside or a mouth aid or looking at it?
Because he didn't give me any more options.
And so if you're going to go talk to that dealership,
you're going into that dealership, correct?
I am.
I'll be there.
I'm telling you,
I get off the work.
I got to meet you.
I'm four.
It'll be done at four, 30.
And then I'm going to go,
see,
here's this idea.
And I'll see what I went over there to you,
to your dealership,
2019.
I thought my vehicle there.
I saw the vehicle I wanted.
I talked to him on the phone.
They made a deal right now on the phone.
They closed trucks over to my office.
And all of that without having to go back and forth.
So I told them how to do it.
Just give me your bottom price.
I don't want to go back and forth.
He said,
for the only thing I can do is take off two thousand off the truck.
We're going to,
you know what?
You did good.
I'm sorry.
I'm not going to take that deal.
So thank you very much for your help.
He said,
thank you sir.
I was it.
So to me,
it just seemed like the deal was done.
There was no room back in negotiating.
And you can't fault me for that.
So they did that at the dealership previously before you cracked.
I don't understand your question.
So I bought the 2019 important market at U of D.
That's it.
Yes.
Okay.
I called them up.
I asked them how much they did everything remote me for you.
Every thing.
And we didn't have to go back and forth.
I liked the number.
They gave me and look at the end of the day.
I think I paid 10,000 more than I should have.
But I was happy they at least worked with me.
And we made the deal and I mean,
my parents don't know.
And so I just,
you know,
Your manager called me out. He said, well, David, don't have to be safe $2,000 off that truck.
And that's it. So, that's it, well, and that's it.
You did your best.
Okay. I mean, I certainly don't want to lose your business.
You know, to somebody else, if you were already a previous customer of ours.
Well, I just think we're very disconnected and what was an Emmy on, sorry?
My name is the NASA.
Vanessa, I just think we're too far apart and looking.
I really don't like doing business with people like that.
I mean, if they don't care to have my business, they're like, okay, I understand.
I don't know that's me. It's a business. We're all going to make money. I get it.
But for him to tell me, well, you know, I'm going to give you 13,000 for your truck.
Okay, well, then, now you're taking advantage of me because you know what I do.
And that's okay. It's part of the doing business.
And then I said, okay, what if you give me this from my truck?
How much can you take off from the vehicle? The sticker price is 93.
You said, well, I can probably do 91.5.
Okay, so you don't even take a 2,000 offer. You know what? We're good.
Let me see how much I have this vehicle online for.
Have you already worked out numbers with that dealership and everything?
Um, kind of over the phone.
They're looking to see how I have told them.
I've been looking at automation.
I'm not asking for much amount of information.
They're giving me 21,000.
So my truck, you're giving me 18.
For my truck. I said, you know, I still owe $5,000.
So there you can. So I really get 13 from it.
And then on the other side, I get 16.
I wish it's not a big deal.
That's supposed to be matched.
And then you need a good price on the truck.
And I'll sign on the down the line.
But apparently you just, I mean, I don't know.
I mean, I get it.
It's a business. I'm not, I'm the same way.
Well, I'm trying to see.
So we have the vehicle listed for 95, 7, 10 with the package discount at 22, 60,
which brings it down to 93, 45, and then you get extra discount,
of 1500, which is a deal discount.
Do you get an amount of 3, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7?
Why?
I don't know. That's what we told me.
I said, well, I'm extremely accurate.
And he said, no, no, you can't get on this one.
I said, okay, well, then what can you take?
That's what prompted the question of what can you reduce our food, your state of price.
Okay. How about you do me a favor?
Because I'm pretty sure you're not going to want to come over here.
And you can't go to that dealership.
Yeah. I mean, we would just love as the customers would just give us the same opportunity
as going to another dealership as they're walking into the dealership.
We would love the opportunity as well.
Yeah, but Mr. Hester, what you don't understand is that you did have it.
I wish that I was ready to be fired.
You came into the dealership.
I want you to give it to me.
I wish yesterday.
I did not know that.
Okay. So if you came in yesterday and they would have
made you a deal when you were here and you were a buyer,
let your tell me, correct?
That's fine.
Okay.
Yes, absolutely. That's why I was frustrated with any drug.
And your drug.
And your corpus.
Yes.
I am so sorry, Mr. David.
Yes, I went to your dealership.
You guys look at my truck.
We couldn't get to the place.
I left Alex called me and said,
hey, my manager wants to talk to you.
There's no problem.
I was already getting to my office.
I told the manager.
I said, um, he said, well, what will it take to you?
I said, can you give me your bottom dollar on the truck?
And I'll decide whether it's the deal.
I want to go back and forth.
And I'm on the road.
Well, as you need to talk for 73, I see you're only $52,000 off.
I said, you're only giving me 13,000 for my truck.
He said, well, um, how much are they going to give you to the truck?
That's it.
21.
If it'll take out the D21 on that,
but I'm not budgeting on the truck.
They're worried about the dealership discount or for this kind of,
oh, no, we don't get that.
Okay.
Then my answer is no.
Okay.
Do you mind if I run this across to myself, manager?
Actually, how much I managed to get.
I really, I really appreciate you calling me and I really appreciate you.
You know, working on that.
But I think that's an internal issue that you guys got.
It's definitely not on me because I have, I made every effort to go to your
facility.
I mean, I think what you have is an internal problem.
And from the sound of it, it sounds like it's maybe a little more frequent than not.
So you can take it to your supervisor, whoever,
I think it says internal problem.
Yes.
Definitely not a buyer problem.
Yes, because I'm in from the list of it is if you're a, your buyer.
And you're ready to buy and you're driving corpus to get a deal done.
And we miss the opportunity for help you.
Well, yeah, absolutely.
Because let me just say this,
where he said, would you have a problem to get me
trying to support?
And I said, I mean, I'm pretty sure I can get a better
dentistry on, on at my bank,
cases, well, no, but you can always, you can always be fine.
If you're a demand of price, you did that right.
I said, yes, I did.
And then I went to your facility in 2019.
I find benefit through board.
And then, you know, two months later, I re-pine.
I said, so I've already done that.
I'm familiar with it.
I was going to go over there to buy a deal.
And just to give you an idea,
I get a vehicle around where I work at.
So, it's easy for me to buy a deal.
Yes, I understand.
Well, if you don't mind, I mean, I don't know.
I really want to have the opportunity to earn your business, but then again,
I mean, I can't force you.
We have the chance to earn it while you were in the dealership.
When we felt to do that,
if you would just not make a rational decision and sign today with that dealership,
if you could just send me their purchase order and see if I could beat that for you.
Do we have your credit and everything already?
I don't think you did.
No, okay.
So, if I can get to the numbers and beat theirs,
what I'll do for you, I'll go ahead and work everything remotely.
Either you can pick up the vehicle once it's all done,
or we could deliver it to you.
But let's see if I could beat those numbers and we'll just go from there.
Yeah, the amount of you just say this and being very transparent,
the only reason I went back to you guys,
even though I know I paid a little extra,
I paid like 10,000 dollars extra dollars up right there.
Even though I did it because of the convenience the other time.
I'm just going to go over there, pick up the price, come back,
they can drop it off to me and then I signed the papers here and all things,
like I did last month and from our way, it's a great opportunity to do that.
It just didn't work out.
Yes, sir.
All right, well, I really appreciate you,
you'll return to my phone call and yes, once you do that,
just get a purchase order.
I'll send you a text message to put my phone number and then send it to me.
and let me see if I could beat that.
Okay, no phone.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll tell you on the stand number.
Thank you.
All right.
Okay.
Bye.
