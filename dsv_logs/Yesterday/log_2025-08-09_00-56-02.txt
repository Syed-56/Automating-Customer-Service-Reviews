Thank you for calling agegreg.com.
This call may be recorded for quality assurance for sales press 1 for everything else press 2.
Hey, it's Chris's.
How am I?
Hey, I've been looking at some of these cars on agegreg and I visited the door all the other
sit today.
I talked with an online guy this morning that I've called and haven't been able to track
him down.
I don't know because whoever you're speaking to.
It was about 9.15 this morning I talked with an online salesman.
Got it.
Let me get them.
Let me see if I can get them on the line.
I'm put your brief order.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, just the online sales representative.
Yes sir.
How can I help?
Hey, I got a call at 9.15 this morning.
Were you who I talked to at 9.15 this morning?
Yes.
We did speak on the phone.
Yes sir.
Okay.
Yeah.
I went over to visit the door all the other ship and got some out of the door prices.
I wasn't very pleased with the Mercedes.
Was looking at the 2021 Jeep Compass that I sent over to tax but somebody just sent me
somebody on your team sent me something saying it was sold.
The one in Orlando.
So I'm looking at a couple more.
It looks like there's one in West Palm Beach that I want to look at and there's also one
in Tampa.
West Palm Beach is pretty close to where we're at here in Miami.
I mean, not close close but like 45 minute hour drive I would imagine.
Oh yeah, because you live in Broadway right?
I believe.
Quite live in South Carolina but I'm in Miami right now.
Oh God you got you.
I mean, yeah, well, car do you want to come to you?
So I'm looking at this 2017 Jeep Cherokee Limited.
The stock numbers W 548194.
Okay, one more.
Yeah, the one for 9400.
The one for 9400.
Yeah, 9400 97.
That one.
West Palm Beach but yeah, we have it available.
Okay, I also really like there's one that's in Tampa and I guess it would involve hopping
on another airplane and being in Tampa tomorrow to pick it up but.
It could be yes, you're open to that we could possibly result.
So there is a way to reserve it so it doesn't get sold like the other one did.
Yeah, if you're coming especially if you're going to hop on a plane, yeah, I mean, well
of course.
Yeah.
Of course.
First off, I want to see if you can double check and confirm about the one in Orlando.
The stock number T557619 that one did sell.
What happened?
I do want to confirm before I look at these cars that the one in Orlando did sell the
T557619.
Did it sell?
That's cheap.
I mean, it shows available.
Did they tell you it's sold?
Yeah, somebody I don't know if it's somebody from the Orlando dealership or what but they
didn't mean like a video message saying I can't find that car on the lot.
I think it sold.
Here's another one.
Yeah, they told you it sold.
What if probably did?
Yeah, because I mean, all my end is showing available.
Yeah, but like if I was to arrange to get it through you, you probably talked to them and
maybe like, oh, it's sold.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, that's my first choice.
If this is available, I would let it, but it's got the one.
Let me tell you, let me give you stock number one in Tampa.
Yeah, if you have a stock number, just say it was some time.
Yeah.
I mean, look, maybe the up one just disappeared.
What happened?
I don't know.
I'm not seeing it.
This is it right here.
Okay.
I think I found it.
The stock number.
Yeah, this one's it.
I like this one a lot more.
I think it has.
No.
The stock number for it is.
Yeah.
I can't find the stock number of it.
Oh, here we go.
T248977.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear it.
I broke up a little.
What was it?
P248977.
Yeah, that one's available.
It is in Tampa, however.
Yeah, you're right.
Okay.
I guess when I went in Doral today in the Doral dealership today, they shared with me all of the
many, many, many fees.
So they gave me like a buyer's contract with all of the fees on it for that Jeep that has sold
the bank.
I mean, if I go there, it's going to be all those same fees, right?
It would be the same.
Yeah.
In other words, yeah, it's just, you know, take the price of this one versus the other one
stick it in there with all those fees and I'm going to out the door, out the door price.
Pretty much, yeah.
Okay.
I think I need to do some thinking over between the vehicles.
I might could go to West Palm Beach today and look at that other one, but.
And then if I decide not that one, maybe I'm heading to Tampa for the other one.
If you want, if you want to come to Palm Beach, you know, I could set that up for you as well.
You know, since you are coming from Miami, we're going to hold the car.
I mean, just text me.
I'll send you the Palm Beach or address.
If you want to come by, just let me know.
Okay.
Yeah.
Let me see if I can arrange to get there and just shoot a text to this number.
Yes, sir.
You can.
The one we were taking earlier.
Okay.
All right.
Sounds good.
Thank you.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Result: [3] No, visit requested/mentioned but no agreement
