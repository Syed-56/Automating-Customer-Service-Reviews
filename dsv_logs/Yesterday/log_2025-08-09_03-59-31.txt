Oh, this has got a nice and neat off here.
Hey, I was going to do it.
Good.
Yeah, just because it might be easier to get on the phone real quick.
Yeah.
Yep.
About this.
So you couldn't.
I was trying to explain it a little bit in tax form.
You couldn't have picked up a better truck.
I was talking to a manager.
I wanted to kind of get an idea.
You especially with where we're at.
I don't know.
I'm in the inventory.
A lot of our good health.
But especially this one.
We're at such a good price on it.
Really, no matter what we gave you for your vehicle, we're going to be in a good spot.
Now, when I say this, next part, I'm not saying that I'm only going to give you like $500 for it.
But all I'm saying is it doesn't matter if I give you $50 or $10,000 for your trade.
No matter what, I can make this truck that you picked work.
It's special.
It's a good company that you have.
You know, the reality of it just figuring out how much we can actually give you for it.
And it all depends on what it is.
I've seen 2014 up on 50s coming and I can only give them $300 for it because of market and conditions.
They come in and rough shapes and then I've seen them come in and I can give three to five grand.
Maybe something grand.
I have no idea.
It just really depends on how much does it need the other.
Right, son?
Does it need a bunch of work to it?
Does it not?
You know what I mean?
No, I don't say where you're coming from.
I mean, my explainer's a couple of scratches, like there's a little scratch on the bumper.
But for the year in the mileage, it's pretty clean.
So I'm not going to go through it.
I'm not going to take a bath on my truck.
Because I could probably sell it out for pretty good money.
And so I'm not going to, that's why I'm asking them to finance and where we're at.
I'm going to get rid of my truck and my car and just go with like a ranger to just drive back and forth to work.
You know what I mean?
And my truck's got $130, $135 on it.
And I don't drive it. It's just in my bar.
And so I thought, well, if I can get out of my truck for decent price.
And then I got a guy at work that really wants to buy myclusions, you know.
And I thought, well, if I sell that and sell that and get a nice ranger,
so it's like what I'm looking at, what's like $30, $40, and I'll just drive that back and forth to work.
You know?
And so that's where I'm at there.
But I'm not going to take a bath to do the deal.
You know what I mean?
It's got to be good for both of us.
Yeah.
100% and I never liked my customers.
To ever feel that way.
At the end of the day, customer, you're always going to make more money, so I'm probably.
That's just the way that works.
The only way offered me to make money is to bring in a vehicle and have some sort of room to sell it for more.
Right?
But a lot of times that also requires us to fix a lot of things that customers don't fix when they sell it on their own.
You know what I mean?
In sometimes, like what you could get away with selling it for without fixing, I can't.
Because because at the end of Ford, it says dealership.
You know what I mean?
You know what?
That's right.
Right, right.
It doesn't matter.
Literally doesn't matter.
You know, here's being a 2014 I can't even certify it.
I can't expect it.
I can't do anything.
You're just going to go into my lot as an as is vehicle.
But some of the things that we, you know, we've had to make a lot right there.
I got to make sure that it runs rides.
Everything's going to be good, right?
And is there anything that I would have to do, you know, to make a lot ready to customer would require.
require therefore they took the memory of it. That's what we have to factor in and
When I think about it and when I talk to customers I always ask them
You know if you were to like think of your truck, right?
If you were to go look it if you were to take your truck drive a two-wheeler shift and park it and
Pick a price right would you then go back and just buy that truck exactly how it is or would you ask them to do as well
I'd be like that's how we look at it
They're even people who love their vehicle. They can always find one two or three things at least
Even if they took a magnitude care that they would ask the dealership to them do
Yep, and that's what we have to look at it, but I never like my customers to feel like they took a bathroom
I gotta tell her work. Have you how to appraise anywhere? You got any numbers? I have and I've just been on a blue book
and just try to get an idea of what
You know what is kind of work, you know what I mean, okay, so where you look I mean
I got a lot idea try the party or trade in I
Was looking at balls
Whatever
What what would make you happy on it? I
Don't know I
know I look a blue book shows
You know and trade in on it according to Kelly Blue Book
You know, I think it was around 12 grand 12 five. I can't remember
11 11 5 to 12 5 or something was trade in
so
So I don't know. I mean, I just I wanted a rough idea what what roughly
You know the value is, you know and
So that's gonna be kind of where I'm at
And if it comes in, you know last of Matt then I'm gonna look at just selling it out right and when it's gone then I'll do so
You know, yeah
But I didn't want to waste your time
It's a lot of waste my time, you know, that's why I was just trying to get an idea
You know, if we're gonna be in the ballpark and you know
There
One in our in our was like, you know customers like you, you know
It's got to make sense right and I get that the real trouble is right is when it comes to
Trucks that are this
When I say they're sold I don't mean in a negative way because that's 2014 isn't that old of a vehicle right?
But a lot of your old right
Like banks are looking at it differently
They they go. Yeah, they won't even they won't even a lot of them won't even give you a loan for more than 36 or 48 months
You know, you start looking at it a little bit differently on that aspect and what they can give or what they couldn't give and
Well, it'll please into a factor, but then we anytime you get over a hundred thousand miles because everything been done to it right as
Is there things that you need to be done? How's the front end like how does it drive like things like that?
That's all affected about you
You know that would make it harder easier to sell right the better the condition the better the drive
You know easier it is for us to sell right because especially
Try to ask for a money. We'll add it on a 2014 to be honest
Anytime we are really really really nice 2014 or something like this
They go in a heartbeat because we never ask enough money because even then the market only
says we can ask for so much
And it's good that happens then they're going in a literally two days
Oh, yeah, you know what I mean
Yeah, yeah
So it just kind of depends. I don't want you to feel like you're you know wasting anybody's time because you're not
You know you're looking if it works for works for that doesn't it doesn't but like I said anything over a hundred thousand miles
Like it's totally different if you see it touch it feel it drive it, you know, that's a big deal
You know, well, I mean you know to Scott
I mean if it's something to shake you guys know roughly what you're gonna get for you know and
So that's why I don't want to waste any place time on a Saturday
To come down there to for you to say well
Give you a grand for it that I'm gonna say gosh
If you told me that I will need a game
I would wait and saw it sold it
You know, I mean and then I'll come by a truck, you know, yeah
Yeah, you know, I don't know how the game works, you know, I used to sell cars in home
Yeah, and it was it was that a poor dealer and so I know a lot of the game works, but you know
I just it's you know a lot of dealerships
They're they're willing to give pretty good money for vehicles to they they want use vehicles for the lot
especially
trucks you know what I mean and so
That's where I'm asking you if you think you can be competitive and give a good fair price
Then I'm willing to come talk tomorrow, but if not then I'm gonna probably try to sell it on my own
Yeah, and then come and if you got something I'm interested in
Then I'll go that route, you know, yeah
I hear you know, I'm I'm I definitely am
Am honestly engaged with you like I want you to make sure that it
Is it makes sense for you a couple of things like are you are you near around the truck or
Like do you know I'm so I'm so working. Okay. Yeah
Do you know like if you join anything to the vehicle recently?
The only thing that I put in there is new
coil packs and plugs
but
Probably six months ago probably
So like I said, I don't put in miles on it when I bought that truck
Scott it had 110,000 and it's got like a hundred and thirty somewhere now and I've had it
I always put them off maybe four or five thousand miles out of the year. Yeah, I don't drive it much, you know
And it's for right
It is
Okay, all others
options with you if you don't mind real quick
Because I want to make sure that we have everything on a design the company's serial system
Yeah, yeah
No, sir
back up camera
Yes
Yes, I should have heated in cool teeth, right?
It does yeah
Back up camera should have beer parking sensors on my right
It does still all right, and then I'm assuming a total package
Total package, you know
Does that have automatic climate control?
Um
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure does it yeah, cuz it says oh yeah, yep driver seat memory should be a standard option on that correct
I
Don't know I never used it to be honest with you
It should be on like the door or something where it'll feel like one two three and set where you can like set your
No, I don't know. I never seen that no
Okay
Let's got let's try it told me yours, you know, and they tell us how
Okay, perfect. Yeah, that was gonna be one of my next
Got a hard power cover out at one of those metal ones of high poles, you know, or clock poles
Bad liner with a rubber mat in it
Um
Got the good, you know, nice floor mats in it. They're nice rubber forward
Navigation right got navigation, yeah
Oh
I got my shirt. Oh, too. Wow
I think I got
Got nice fg rich all three entire zar no probably
Yeah, I haven't even really looked at them
By the tires are good you start yeah, they're probably
70% probably there'd be a good drizzle of trains
When children tips for facts real
How's the rest on that for a 14
Um, it's getting starting to bubble just a little bit around those sensors on the back bumper on the one sensor
But fire is any
rough coming through or nothing
Is running like significant done things scratches
I mean like into the pain
Like yeah, there's on the front bumper there's one it may be about three inches long on it on the corner
Um
It was like it when I thought I was gonna get a picture I never did but on the back of the tailgators like a little
Just a little debt that drove me nuts
But it's on the back challenges like in the bottom or a lot like something was less than the bumper when they open the tailgate
You know what I mean? Yeah, and it was yeah, and I was always I got a place to get a fix and I never done it but
Other man I mean it's pretty quickening you know yeah
And you don't have any other pictures of it
Other than I don't look and see I did have some but I got a look and see
Okay
It's yeah, I was going through my pictures when I sent you that one I was thinking yeah
I thought I had some more pictures somewhere
Yeah, if you wouldn't mind it like I don't know are you like even when you get home is that a possibility? Oh
Yeah, yeah, okay, when you get home if you don't mind
I'm here till seven tonight. I'm not gonna be in tomorrow. I just so have
You know, I I would do one one bigger weekend on my mom's the summer
So it was only down in Jackson and I go into here, but I'm gonna set you up to blow my better guys here
There's only a couple of I trust to some customers too
But I'm gonna try and get some of this lift out tonight
To give you a better idea
Um
Before I leave here
Okay
That probably will I'm gonna be honest. I probably will
Get home roughly till about six o'clock
From Jackson sorting and giving much kind probably time I
Pull it out and take few pictures of it to be inside and stuff like that and yeah, and then outside is outside of zoom in like on
You know a couple of out there like that strength on the front bumper
I'll try to zoom in on that tailgate. I can show you what that is
Yeah, like you could like
Like don't let's go zoom in on the camera just like move like like go up close to it with your phone
To go up with spots
Cuz the zoom it'll get it'll come through more pixelated
Okay, a lot closer
To the spots that you want to see with your phone and if you wouldn't mind like
And I'm assuming there's like no check engine lines or any lights on the dash
No, no, no, no, just a picture from each corner
Other than the angle that you already sent me
And then like there are a couple of scratches and then that you're you're sent in and then a couple of the inside and stuff like that
And then you know the things that we talked about like the rest and like just those they have an idea of the
You know if I'm gonna I'm gonna have a touch up guy
You know touch up that kind of stuff
I need to know how much money it's gonna cost because the way we usually work
You know different things is if we train serial cable this is
You know for for a lot of pricing options, right? We see
Like for a lot of us ships we usually start off of right like fair
Fair price of Kelly will look and then we discount off of that for what we might have to do
Right. Yeah, yeah because for the most part not everybody like
If you're gonna work for the select few people that actually take phenomenal care of their vehicles
But on the general consensus we run it that way because for the most part people don't take phenomenal care of their vehicles
Um, that's why we have to do it that way
But yeah
Let me let me get an idea. Let me touch face with him and see what he's kind of thinking
Work like a sharp truck. I think we could for sure use something like this on our honor a lot
I'd love to see something like this. So
Um, yeah, let me let me get an idea and you figure it's around that 135 mark right
Yeah, I'll get an exact address just between like 134 135. I believe
Yeah, I know we're right because I just I just changed oil on it. Yeah, I just changed oil on it. I can't remember what
I can't remember but um, but yeah, I'll do that for you and send it over to you and then we'll just kind of go from there
Yeah, no worries. Yeah, any things here like I know come do it a little bit more like work like this right now because
if it's like that and
You know, it actually
Say you trip from coming down here because we're just a little far away yet and you want to post it and you think more money that way
Then that just helps you you know what I mean
Yep, yep
So yeah, okay, let me do this and and we'll go from there. Okay
Okay, that was good. Thanks so much for talking to you soon. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah
All right
