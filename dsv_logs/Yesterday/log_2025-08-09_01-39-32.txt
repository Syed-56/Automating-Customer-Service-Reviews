Transcript:
This is how maybe recorded.
I can go.
Thank you for choosing to play out at Anchorage.
Maybe how they wrote your call.
I'm going for Mac, boat right?
It's not just an instruction.
It's a piece of marx.
We can tell you more and settle your service when our call continues.
Your vehicle is an investment you want to keep running strong.
I can go see and invest in our service professionals who are certified technicians
and maintain current training to ensure your car trouble and SUV gets the best possible care.
We also invest in CZR facility with a latest right now to put mid-end improvement.
Thank you for helping us. I have lots of other life issues.
Thanks.
Hi, this is Max.
Hey, Max, being a bring-all.
I guess I didn't realize the air all couldn't come without me.
You can have that card.
Yeah, it's been right.
Yeah.
And hitting my apologies.
You see, I got a little confused when you text me there.
The arrow was going to be here.
I got a coworker named Carol.
And I thought, oh, maybe we were in touch with him.
I know sometimes we have failed people reaching out over Facebook.
So, any who I thought maybe you were just in contact with another failed person here.
And yeah, so when your son, arrows go down, I realized the confusion.
So, right.
Something can stop by and stop.
Something you're going to be there the whole time.
Well, and more or less, it's not, you know, getting a value or a place you want to be able to take us a very long time.
It is just one of those legal oversight that we need to do.
You know, where somebody comes in, we don't want to be making offers on cars for the people who don't know them.
More or less.
So, yeah, I mean, we can, if you have to, sometimes, to stop on buy, I'm sure we can at least make an offer on it.
If it's something that makes any sense and, you know, of course, you're here to, I'd love to take some to call me if you're interested.
But, yeah, we just want to make sure if we're presenting numbers on a vehicle, we're, we have the own of present at that same extent.
So, I'm thinking now that I find a thing in this, the reason you want the own of present is because you actually want to make it, you want to make it a transaction that's held to be another vehicle.
Correct.
I'm in there.
You know, I'm fair to say.
I would say we're motivated to buy our vehicles.
Yes.
But also, there is just some guidelines that we have to follow where, you know, we can't just do that.
Yeah, I don't mean to have another candidate to do that.
I guess that's not about it.
I know, yeah, you guys are actually, you don't want to waste your time.
You want to sell a vehicle to the person that could buy a vehicle.
Or buy a vehicle.
But when it comes to, to appraising a vehicle and giving, they can offer on it or give an evaluation.
You know, anybody can.
And I know if you're done, but, you know, it just falls under those if somebody brings a car.
But isn't there, you know, where, yeah, I got it.
Yeah, I got it.
Yeah, I got it.
Okay, cool.
And he said you're in my desk in time tomorrow.
But, yeah.
But we're not, I mean, it's not, it's not urgent.
We just, yeah.
So, okay, cool.
I've been just logging on my answer to the confusion on that.
I wouldn't call it yet, but I'm not thinking about it.
I'm not a person.
I'm bottom.
He was a lawyer, he was made with me that I didn't know that.
I'm like, well, yeah, I mean, like, sorry for all that.
I mean, it makes sense.
It makes sense.
Okay, cool.
I'll figure out what our schedule looks like in time.
Okay.
There are three videos in the video.
You said the four runners that come in or you go three stalls.
Yeah, right?
The four runners we get in have been getting to pause.
I know I've got a couple of years that I can just very least,
but you take a look around and get a good idea what they're all about.
But I've got to call them as readily available right now too.
Yeah, we're not, I'm not quite sure we're sure we're going to go next.
But, um, did they, did they still make, I couldn't find it.
They still make the whole other piece like we have.
Um, yeah, yeah, did you?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, you can get the premium models and then we've got a couple here too.
Um, yeah, you'll get the weather interior.
They're actually a little bit more upgraded from, from previous year models.
You get cooled seeds too.
Plus the heat is the moon roof.
Heat is searing wheel.
So there's some new updates there as well.
Are you going to have to do like the limit if you can close it in the outdoor or whatever?
Any off road yet?
Are you coming home after?
Okay, I'll do.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Thank you.
