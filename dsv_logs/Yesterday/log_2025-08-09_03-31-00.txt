Welcome to Honda of Tombal.
Where your journey works.
That's a great day, Honda.
Tombal, how many are your director calls?
South, please.
OK, one moment.
It is a great day on the tunnel.
This is Mike and the South Department.
How many are there?
Hello, nice to meet you.
Hello, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Carson.
Hi, I am sorry.
We would be there again.
My speak to someone and your parcel.
In part?
No.
Hello.
OK.
Yes, sir.
I can help you.
I can't hear you well, but yes,
I'm so it's not going to help you.
My name is Mike.
How are you?
Pretty good, yourself.
Pretty good, too.
I get in ready for Saturday.
How can I help you?
Yes, I was saying fine because I think that you guys have the,
oh, I'm not sure.
I just seen it online, but I'm sure it's still available.
But Honda Civic SI, let me see if I can pull up this talk for you.
So, 35?
Yes.
Let's see.
The black one, right?
Yes, ma'am.
OK, yes.
I saw it this morning, so we still have it available.
Let's see.
Let me look at that for you as well.
On my end.
Let's see.
Tom Ball.
And the model is the Civic SI.
All right.
Let's see.
All right.
So I have two black ones and the Arvind Gray.
So which one of the two black ones you're interested in?
The 23 or the 2025?
The 25.
The 25.
Great option.
So actually, I would know this story about this person
in Hawaii's only 90 miles.
He bought the car and when he got home, the white state.
Nope.
Nope.
So he has to return there literally the next day.
But it is.
And it is, yeah.
So it is technically brand new.
He had to trade it for a year because that's what the white wanted it.
And so you just trade it in the next day.
The thing for whoever buys this vehicle
is that you still have 35,910 miles under your Honda warranty,
bumper to bumper for a new vehicle.
And then when you hit the 36,000 miles,
you're going to have up to 100,000 miles or seven years,
certified warranty.
So buying a new car.
But all is going to be all of it.
On this, then, do you guys happen to have any deals or incentives
or what it still be?
Because it's still be classified under lease?
We can try a lease.
Yes, we can definitely, we actually
do lease under 6,000 miles.
And this one is only 90.
So yes, we can definitely store the options.
What you can come in today or tomorrow?
Well, honestly, what I'm trying to do
is I was trying to get it under my business name.
OK.
Maybe do my business.
I can maybe, I don't know if they offer
like the route where I can do the front door.
I'm sorry, if you can do.
Like where they can run, use, kind of run my credit,
but it was still beyond the business name.
Exactly.
Yes.
So we need your IN number, the IN number information
about your company.
Probably, they're going to ask you for your last tax returns
on your company.
But definitely, you can do that.
There's a lot of people that actually
now are using their business to buy vehicles instead of your person.
Well, they're having a personal.
This program yours, but it goes through your business.
And what that goes, thanks, me,
because you used for the business.
What was your credit for?
How's your credit?
Oh, listen, the 6.50, 6.60.
OK.
Well, if you decide to lease, we're
going to do it with Honda financial.
So only Honda financial will lease Honda vehicles.
If you decide to go to route to financing,
we can also try to Honda financial.
We have more than 30 banks.
Do you have any down payment in mind?
OK.
All right.
We'll have to explore the options on both either lease
or financing.
But if you have some time today or tomorrow,
I would love to set up an appointment for you to come in.
Of course, first, check the car.
Hopefully you like it.
And then we can check your credit and they
go from there, which option will be better for you,
lease, or finance with your company.
Do you have some time today or tomorrow?
I'm going to be out of the town this weekend for a work.
So I'm just going to just kind of want to see any ballpark numbers
so I feel like the rough idea will put the numbers in.
OK.
I can definitely do that for you.
And I'm sorry.
I didn't ask your name at the beginning of the conversation.
Yeah, my name is Irvin.
OK.
And you're laughing.
More young.
All right.
And your phone number.
Be one, two, correct?
Correct.
OK.
What's a good email for you so I can thank you,
a quote.
The second definition, a quote on what is the numbers
that you can look at?
Your finance, you know what you think?
Yeah, that you know, B.
OK.
Let me go.
M-O-R-M-O-R.
OK.
All right.
OK.
Let me go.
M-O-R-M-O-R.
Yeah.
M-O-R-M-O-R.
Yeah.
M-O-R-O-R.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah.
OK.
All right.
Maddy, don't.
Maddy, don't.
Maddy, don't.
Yeah.
Maddy, don't.
Yeah.
Maddy, don't.
Maddy, don't.
Yeah.
OK.
So let me have one of my managers to work on this.
And then I can email you text it to your post.
And then it's those numbers.
You know, this fellowship, we don't have any atoms.
So I'm always going to show you the price of the vehicle
your taxes and your fees.
which your fees is actually just the place and credit
registration.
So we don't have any items as other things,
the receipt does.
But I can definitely get that to you if possible today.
So if you agree on numbers and you're very interested,
we can go ahead and set up an appointment.
I can have a card ready for you.
Tomorrow, I'll be here.
I know you say you'll be out of town.
But tomorrow, I'll be here nine and in tonight,
and I'll be here 10 to 9 until 9.
10.
All right.
But let me go ahead and change your app quote,
and go from there.
Very well.
All right.
Thank you for your copy.
Thank you.
