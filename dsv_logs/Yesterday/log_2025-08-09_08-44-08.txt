Okay.
That's what's up here.
Hey, guys, what's up here?
It's Brian.
Yeah, how you doing?
Sure.
Are you with the client?
No.
I actually want to be in my charge.
So you're not Maddie, yeah.
You're not to go anywhere.
No, I said so.
I went again and it's last night.
It can be get together.
Here's probably that I'm over.
I'm not in a map of hurries or to get it done.
Alright.
that I have to call her out of spring on Sunday.
I come home on Wednesday of next week.
I see these trucks like all over the place
that went to Riverside last night,
and we're at stat one,
and I forgot to say the quick and big.
I didn't tell you how to decide it, right?
It's one thing to go from like to 1500 to the 2500.
And so I almost like to,
I almost need to like borrow one for like an hour
and go figure out if I could pull it
into our parking garage,
down below, right?
And just like see how I'm gonna like,
you know, figure pull it into that thing.
I mean there's everyone else is doing it,
right?
I just have never done it before.
Right?
So that's the one thing that makes me nervous, right?
If that is a,
as that's what you do with a height curve,
I mean I got like 50 feet.
Okay.
It is like I said, you're my building earth.
But that was it.
I just went over there to like take a look.
They're all, it's like just 18 floors are all the same.
Like change it.
You can say it every night.
It's just a bigger car.
Yep.
So that's my room you have a taste.
Right?
It's just wrapping my freaking head.
It's fun for you.
You get to roll the work with like,
you know, park wherever you want, right?
Sure.
So that's all.
And I got all excited about my Tuesday
when I got that text.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I should give it a little bit.
And then like literally on that same day Tuesday,
I spent like three hours finagantly a spot on the bottom floor.
Yeah.
Right.
And so now I got one.
I have any of you guys like,
hey man,
yeah, it's yours.
And you want it, you know, whatever.
But we'll go to mine up yet because I'm on the special floor
and then I reserve like spot, you know,
but then I'm going to have to park in with the river
and I'm going to have to park in the water.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know yet.
That's my own.
I just see it on it.
I don't want to have to have slow that shit.
Yeah.
Right.
So do I like to track that?
Do I think they're freaking badass?
Right.
But like I said, I have not driven one.
Okay.
Right.
Like at all.
And you know,
I just, like you guys have these beautiful ones that like,
I don't even care if you hop in the car with me.
So I can send you on a BPA and one of the new ones.
I don't think I've got any news.
They can put access out there.
Oh, it can, it doesn't need to be an H4X.
It can be like a year's like,
like, freaking 2500.
All you have to take me to lunch, right?
Or whatever.
Or breakfast.
We'll do it early in the morning when it doesn't like.
So click with your, you know what I mean?
Your, like, biggie, like clients, schedule or whatever.
But that's the other thing I got to do it is I've been trying
to find Cory because I think Cory has one.
He didn't come in about other things.
Okay.
You know, we can hit him up like, hey, maybe he or cheese, you know?
That's correct.
And just ask if I should like settle with his shirt for a minute.
He would get his thought as, like I said, he doesn't, he would even come in.
But yeah, I know.
Well, I hope you have a very popular movie.
At least you got to show that up on 2500.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
And then we're going to ask you, I might not do an all black dude.
I might do that, like, that, like, it looks like a slow,
over one.
Okay.
You have one.
You have a four.
Okay.
Yeah, like, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I don't know if I'm going to do that.
That's another thing.
If I could spin it in there.
Cool.
If you're going to be a black hard-grandwin, I think you guys have those.
Sure.
Well, go home with our big few brother and I appreciate you wasting your time with me.
So, I mean, I'm in here.
Okay.
