Thank you for calling Fontana Motors Direct for sale.
For customer service.
Connecting you to our sales department.
Please hold.
Thank you for calling Fontana Motors.
I'd like to bring to speaking.
How can I help you?
Hi, do you rest off of the 2020 true Chrysler Pacifica?
And why don't you take a look?
You said 2022, Chrysler Pacifica, correct?
Yeah.
All right, let's see here.
I'm only seeing a black on our own.
Are you sure it's a 2022?
Yeah, but this post was from two months ago.
So you may not have this one.
OK, I do have another white one though.
Oh yeah, let me try that.
OK, the window that you want all of it
are just the last couple.
Give me the last eight.
OK, one, two, three, four, four.
N is an answer you are in Reagan, 1-8-6-305.
Oh yeah, it looks like that one gets so.
OK, that's a good price.
I want the exact same thing.
All right, let me see how much this one was going for again
to see if I have something that's around the same.
OK, so right around that, 2599 mark.
Yeah, I'm trying to keep it at 20 grand.
I'm looking for, obviously, the newer and the better,
the lower the miles, the better.
I'm particularly looking for this model
because of the feature that folds all the way down
at turn into cargo space because I'm transporting dogs.
I own the dog results.
So, all right.
You.
That's very cute.
So that's why I want this.
I would never buy a Chrysler otherwise, honestly.
Gotcha.
OK, let me see.
All right, so I have another 2020 Chrysler Pacifica touring
L. So, same thing.
Just a little bit of an older model.
It has a 22, it's a 2020.
And 12 from 1999 with 40,000 miles.
OK, you're rather one of the way
you better deal with the 22 with 12,000 miles.
Yeah, I know.
That one we got that one, and it went pretty quickly
to be honest with you.
Yeah.
Do you guys, I need one, like, I'm trying to buy one this weekend.
So do you guys have other viewers?
Or do you can use that one for me in this?
I want the same deal with the market place.
I want that card.
Gotcha.
Now, I area.
The only Pacifica I have right now are the, I have two ones,
a 2017 Pacifica touring L. And the other was a 2020.
Unfortunately, I don't have any more 2022's.
OK, and the 17, the black one.
Yeah, it's one we just received, not too long ago.
16, 4,9, 9 with 46,000 miles.
And it's a velvet red pearl coat.
That's what the color says.
I have to put eyes on it to verify the color for you.
OK.
OK.
But do you just get these in on tracers?
You guys get them at the auction.
Either or, whichever one.
Sometimes we get them on trade.
Sometimes we get them from auctions.
It just depends.
When are you all going to the auction again?
Unfortunately, I don't control that.
That's when the company's buyer decides to go out.
I mean, we're getting new inventory every single day.
It's just a matter of when we're going to get another white 2022
Pacifica touring L. I unfortunately don't know.
Yeah.
OK.
All right.
Well, thank you.
Not a problem.
You didn't want to come check out any of the other two
Pacifica's I have because the other one, it's the white one.
It's just a 2020.
You guys had another one on it.
2022.
Well, that was five months ago.
That's probably gone.
It's a 2020 white how many miles around it?
40,000.
And what's the price?
1999.
We're on this one.
Well, we're actually already discounting the price quite a bit
because typically these are retailing for 24
for this particular model in here with this mileage.
Why does that other one have changed?
Unfortunately, I'm not 100% sure.
It could have been the car fax report.
Car fax report could have been bad on it.
I mean, unfortunately, we price all of our vehicles to sell.
We might have just gotten that one for a steal.
I've been able to list it for that.
You know what I mean?
This one we also got for a steal on it
has a clean car fax report.
Retail on these things are going for 24 right now.
We're at 19.
What would you do like 20 out the door?
Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to do that.
I mean, we're able to work out a deal, but 20 out the door.
I mean, I can't discount my car any more than I already
have the discount it.
But what kind of deal can you give me then?
I mean, I want to make sure you like the car
and like the way it drives first and come in here.
Because obviously, you were looking for a particular one.
I don't want you to come.
but we've discussed all numbers now on this particular vehicle.
And when you actually get out here and you test drive it,
you like it.
You hate it.
Yeah, I've been looking at these on the end.
I've looked at probably 15.
But I'm always seeing more time of dealership.
No, of course.
I mean, we'd probably be at the retail price
out the door, which is anywhere between 24 and 25.
I can't give the exact out the door.
Because unfortunately, I don't know what it's going to be
until you come in.
But you'd be getting the vehicle at global market price
on this one.
The out the door is going to be right around what they would
typically go for.
So you're already in a positive equity position after purchasing it.
OK, will you have a link to that one?
Can you talk to me?
Of course.
And is this a good number to text you on?
Yes.
Can you like, you know, I want the pictures of the one
you're talking about?
No, of course.
Is this Britney?
Yes.
Beautiful.
Awesome.
OK.
I was able to look up your phone number on our system
and it looks like you came up.
We'll see.
I've been shopping these things.
So go for the phone.
Or just telepathic.
I know your name.
I just texted you a link right now.
Can you confirm that you received it?
Oh, let's see.
Oh.
Where was that motor's correct?
Oh, I'm.
There's today.
Oh, you were here today?
Yeah, there's today.
I looked, you guys have another one.
It's like 13,000.
It's like, jumped up.
I'm not saying that one on my website.
I'll be honest.
Well, if you came in this morning, why didn't you
buy a few of my me asking?
What happened?
Well, because the one that you guys had was junk.
And I mean, Chrysler's are junk.
Let's see on this with each other.
I would never buy a Chrysler.
I just, they don't hold their value.
I'm actually kind of scared to buy one.
I'm only buying one because of the seat situation.
But looking at my mask because I came down the valley.
I don't know.
Because I don't have the Chrysler going for 13,000 right now.
OK.
Well, maybe I wasn't there.
OK.
So let me get back to my trick.
Let's just make sure I got this link.
Am I just, maybe I just called.
I don't know.
I'm going across.
I'm looking at white Chrysler Pacific.
That's how I go when I was looking for my Honda.
I was looking at so many.
And then next thing you know, I just don't remember
what you're looking at.
I know they're all the same after a while, right?
They all look the same.
Yeah.
That's why I strongly urge you to come into the dealer,
at least check it out.
And if it works out, we could discuss some numbers.
Where are you coming from?
The Netherlands.
Where?
Let's go.
You're not too far away.
I live right out of the Marito Valley.
So that's only about 40 minutes with traffic.
Oh, yeah.
I mean, it's probably not even that far,
but it's going to come.
Are you going to be there tomorrow?
Yeah, yeah.
OK.
What do you know about the reliability
of these Chrysler Pacific?
Well, you're lucky.
Because I actually used to work for Dodge.
Well, you used to sell these things quite a bit.
So these Pacifica's, I mean, if you're
keeping up to date with the maintenance, obviously,
on it with regular oil changes, every 5, 6,000 miles on it,
you take care of it the way it should,
it's going to take care of you.
Now, obviously, you know, everyone has other opinions
about these Chrysler's, especially the Pacifica's.
But the Pacifica's, in my opinion, are one of the better vans
that Chrysler, as one of the better vehicles Chrysler
has put out, as for reliability.
OK.
So you're priced on it, $19, $9, $9, $9, $9, $9.
Yes.
OK.
So, tax and licensing you type of, I mean,
what can you do for me?
Do I have to be in there for you?
Tell me that.
Yeah, unfortunately, you do.
Because I have to verify the license
and verify all that information before we, you know,
are able to give that out.
Because I don't actually get access until we actually
scan the license.
If the system that we have here, that prevents me from doing that.
Just because we have run into fraud issues before.
I mean, obviously, I want to get you the best
deal possible on up my job.
Right?
And I'm able to do that.
I just, I urge you to come on out here, check it out,
especially this weekend, because we have
ourselves, if I'm going on.
What's that entail for this particular vehicle?
Just again, I don't have to have you come in to kind of
explain that exactly how it entails, because they don't
give me any numbers until I have the customer in front of me.
So it'll be less than that, though.
No, the price is going to stay the same.
I mean, at this, though, we're just giving out some really
good deals right now, as, you know, because we're getting
some really good interest rates as well if you're
financing the vehicle with the banks.
We have really good relationships with them.
So we also, we, that's kind of how we're also
getting out some really good deals at the moment.
Did you plan on financing the vehicle?
Well, I'm going to finance it through my business.
My business has been around for two years.
So I may have to be a guarantee on it.
But I have excellent business credit.
My personal credit, because of the business, is probably
good, very good.
OK.
So your credit does have credit?
What?
Does your credit, does your business have credit?
Yeah, my business has extra.
Perfect.
OK.
OK.
No, yeah, I just, a lot of, we have some customers that come in
thinking they can, you know, obviously, wanting to do that.
But the business turns out that doesn't have credit.
But if that's the case, you know, that's awesome.
We've been getting some good interest rates when it comes to
business loans with US, with customers as a personal
caretour.
OK.
All right.
Well, tell nobody else that we'll get it until I get there.
Because I like the price.
I mean, I will take a little less there.
Now here you come in.
Let me work my magic for you.
Let me get, you know, show it to you.
And let me show you what I can do on the numbers.
What time would be a good time for you tomorrow?
Well, what time are you personally there?
Because I only want you.
Gotcha.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
I'll be here tomorrow, right around what's tomorrow's
Saturday.
Yeah.
OK.
I'll be in here right around 11 o'clock.
OK.
And you'll be there for late in tonight.
But I'm not going to be there.
It'll probably be early afternoon.
I don't exactly know.
But I'm going to have my 10-year-old daughter.
We got to make this happy.
Happy.
Yeah, we can definitely do that.
Don't worry.
You got this open to the like, speeding kit there.
Customer is in and out quickly.
Would like 12 o'clock work for you?
Yeah, roundabout.
I mean, don't exactly hold me to that.
If you have somebody else waiting for you, then help them.
But I mean, around there, yeah, that sounds good to me.
But I'll just set up for one.
Just to kind of get you some leeway in front of the face
to be able to get in here on time.
So I'll set up for one.
I'll send you a quick text.
And then I'll have the vehicle pulled up ready to go for you too.
That way it's, you know, we could get you in and out of here.
OK, this is not hybrid, right?
This one specifically?
Yeah.
No, this one's going to be this 3.6 liter.
It's a fixed element.
So it's fully gas.
OK.
And then if I buy this today, there's
somebody that can help me get it home,
because I'm going to be in my vehicle.
And my 10-year-old daughter.
No, yeah.
We can definitely figure that out.
You would just have to let it look redlands, right?
Well, I definitely would be kind of,
but we could drop it off in redlands
that my business simply needed to.
OK, no, yeah.
We can definitely split that out.
And even if I have to drive one of the vehicles back,
we can figure that out.
That won't be a problem.
OK.
Is there anything wrong that you know
of with this thing, like, is the headliner rift or?
No, the last time I saw that it was actually
an excellent condition.
If you would like, I can go outside to the mise on it
and send you a couple of pictures
of the interior and the exterior.
No, you don't have to do that.
It's OK.
OK.
Well, what do you think about it?
This is probably, is it still in your factory warranty?
This one?
Let me see.
That's actually good question.
Let me run my check on it real quick.
So on this one, unfortunately, the manufacturer warranty
has expired.
But the beautiful thing is all of our cars come
with the three-year warranty, where you could actually
take it directly to the manufacturer.
They come with that?
Yeah, it's just it does.
It is a little bit extra, but it's only about like 40 bucks
extra on the monthly payment for a full three-year term.
I can do a little bit longer.
I'm probably going to get you a killer price
if you want to go ahead and look at those two for the next
kind of warranty.
Is that good for $40,000 miles or three years?
100% it is.
I can also extend the term for you, too, if you would like.
OK.
And is that a big price?
If I were to pay cash for that extended warranty,
does it amount to like $2,500?
Right around there.
Yeah.
It's actually a typical price for that three-year.
It's just I have to run the act.
I have to get the actual number for it.
Because it varies depending on vehicle to vehicle.
Obviously, BMW warns you for three years
and not going to be the same as the camera
you want in two to three years.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Well, I've been looking at you for a kind of familiar
with what it covers.
It's a powertrain, warranty, right?
Full coverage.
Powertrain, AC, electrical suspension, all mechanical parts
of the vehicle.
It doesn't cover wearing terror items.
OK.
But since you worked at Dodge before,
like, do you say these are more reliable?
But what is the actual like family thing?
Does he take care of them?
Is it like 120,000 miles?
I've seen these ago until like 180.
Well, the last time before I left the Dodge dealership,
I still last one, I took it on trade.
There had 210,000 miles on it.
OK.
Overall, I mean, they're pretty.
I'm not going to be put.
I mean, I guess I'll get the warranty.
I was going to.
So here goes just a really fast story.
I almost bought one today.
I'm sitting down at a dealership,
and they tried to crack on this $1,100 fee.
For some app that allowed you to schedule online,
talk to a person, get some savings, discount,
and we'll sell $1,100 for like a customer service app.
Yes.
And I would say, you're yes.
I became proud.
And that's where I said, oh, my name's in your system
to the big bitch next to it because I'm in there.
Because I was like, I'm not paying that.
Take it off.
Oh, we can't.
Why not?
Because it comes built into the old new and used cars.
Well, you didn't tell me that yesterday when I was here.
We'll take it off.
I can't.
Then lower the sales price or this warranty price.
Oh, we can't do that.
But I left.
Gotcha.
So needless to say, I'm just like overshopping me.
I don't want to do it anymore.
So we need a van for my work.
Gotcha.
No, I understand.
Well, come in here.
I'll take care of you, Brittany.
My name is Brayton.
I value obviously good customer service
and good relations with my customer.
So come in here tomorrow.
Ask for me.
I'll take care of you.
OK.
And will you?
I guess you're out there, actually.
OK.
I'll just say the window.
OK, sounds good.
I will see you tomorrow.
OK?
Awesome.
I actually just set up that appointment for you.
You should have just received a text as well.
It's going to have the appointment time
with the address all in there for you as well.
OK.
Cool.
Thank you.
All right, not upon Brittany.
I will see you tomorrow.
I want to clock.
You have a good rest of your night.
You too.
Thanks.
You're out of problem.
