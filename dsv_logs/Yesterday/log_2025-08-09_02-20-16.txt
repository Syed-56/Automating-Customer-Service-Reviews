A sales worker.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

All right.
Hey, thank you for coming up.
So, thank you.
Okay.
I'm Jim.
Good morning.
Hey, thank you.
Goodbye.
Oh, you're welcome.
That's super cool.
Sorry.
That's very slow.
I'm not about a great challenge.
Bye.
Can I jump?
Bye?
No?
No.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Thank you.
They'll be part of the rub.
Hi Rob. This is Angel.
Hello?
Hey, yeah, I'm trying to get a hold of you.
Yeah, so what you can do is you got to come in here, let my team appraise the car, and it will do the math, and then see what, how much money it's going to take to get out.
At least I give you a dollar amount, you'll be able to say yeah, I can make that happen or no, that's definitely not even feasible.
Well, I mean, that's just really like I could put a decent amount down, but the thing is, like, I try to do the numbers before I go in, because it's like such a long drive.
Yeah, the problem is with the amount of negatives, I need the team to look at everything.
They're going to have to step up, like, discount, step up on your car, but a lot of working pieces to make it happen.
Yeah.
My thing is like, my thing is like, are you guys willing to do it though?
Yeah, I mean, if it's possible, brother, I'm going to most definitely make it happen.
I want you in the car you want, but we'll be able to find out once everything's here, you know, if it's feasible.
But if you got cash, you know, and a little bit of patience, we can make it happen.
Were you coming out?
From the Ucaya, so it's like two and a half hours away.
Yeah, what's funny is I work for 27 years with here.
He's running that dealership up there, but they don't have nothing.
I like it.
So what do you think, like, do you think we can get like 503 if everything's good on the car?
No, because again, we sold you the car for 57, right?
What I got to do is I got to play on the other side.
What are you looking to put down? What's the maximum you could put down?
What's the maximum I'm trying to put down is like seven.
Okay. Okay. And who was your salesperson?
Would it Sean?
Yeah.
Okay. What I'm going to do is I'm not sure I'm going to reach out to you in the next couple hours.
Get all the information, basically which car, everything.
Let me put everything in the blender and see how close or how far.
Then I'll call you back and I'll tell you if I see light and if we do definitely drive if I'm like, bro,
it's going to be a distance.
Then I'll give you that information too.
Okay. Can you make sure you call me back, bro?
Because last time you told me I'm on the.
Yeah, I'm going to walk to Sean.
All right. Now to get this all started.
Okay. Thank you.
You're always, man. No problem.
Okay.
Well.
