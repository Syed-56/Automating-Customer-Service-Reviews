This car is from the car tax.
Hello, this is Gabbardman.
Hello, yes.
It's our call.
Come on, if you wish I'm sorry, I'm driving down the road.
Yes, sir. This has been a report that you've been to.
Okay, I'm so sorry. I wish I could have put a pen.
And I got this guy.
I should pass on just for a second.
I'm doing what you said.
I don't know if it's someone that I'm used for.
I can help you out.
Okay.
I was just going to go into car bank.
And there was a key hobby.
24.
I don't know.
7, 8,000 miles, where's the 8,000 miles on it?
I'm talking about the Gladiator.
The 24.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
The Gladiator.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was your question about it.
I,
I,
I own a two-grant guarantee.
I bought a fair grand jury to use for office.
Good.
Good.
I joined the high on my motorhome.
And I had sold a truck and realized damn money.
So,
so I want to see about getting rid of the shirts that I've got.
And the chief grand chair, if you have got to go with something that's going to
solve my problems and allow me to carry it.
But, you know, that's kind of what I'm looking for.
That particular,
well, how do I like that color?
Yeah, I think it's a good looking color.
I like that.
I like that.
That's a great.
Yeah, the new,
the new colors that,
the new colors that came out with this year are hideous.
Yeah.
Those that are on the green.
Yeah, I went to a local dealership just to see what 25 they had.
And they were hideous.
They were absolutely horrible.
I was wondering if I could go with it.
I wouldn't die in here, those.
So, it's kind of where I'm at.
I wanted to.
Yeah, I can, I can sell my,
my Jeep to come on our car masks or more of those.
But it was certainly a lot easier if I could work out a deal,
which you've dropped over there.
And once you can come home in enough.
Yeah, that would work out a lot better for you.
I feel like with the tax savings and everything like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
