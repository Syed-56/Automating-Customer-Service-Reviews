Thank you, according to Mr. Rama, Director Cole.
Yeah, trying to get somebody a salesman in pre-owned.
Yes, sir. I can assist you. What vehicle are you looking at?
It's a blue Mustang, 2014 Mustang.
That's probably 2024, must I?
Okay. Let me pull it to Mr. Samrae quick.
Okay. Yes, sir.
Yes, I'm looking at it.
Which 27,000 miles is actually available, sir?
Okay. So here's my question.
We live in Louisiana and we're looking for a cause similar to that.
It's not actually a CO-o-boned, but before I drop over there,
I'm going to make sure that it's even doable.
We've got, you may not even have any markup.
I don't know what you've got in a used car like that.
I'm actually got a little experience from new cars, but not used.
But anyway, he sold his car.
He sold his little, my son's in high school.
He sold his little car for 10,000 even.
We told him we would give him 20, so he's got $30,000.
And that's it.
So we need the car with T.T. and they'll walk out the door for 30 or some car.
Actually wanted it to be a lot less than 30.
Actually, it wouldn't even have some money like that.
But it completely has a chance.
I don't know if those numbers are going to work or not.
And I'm damn sure I'm going to drive all the way to that one.
I can't understand.
That's the case of the car.
Yeah, it's not going to work.
You know what I mean?
But it has some other options.
I mean, I have a lot of mustings.
I can take your links.
I'm just very particular.
Yeah, you send me a lot of things.
I think we're like the most same premium because of the...
It all revolves around the damn screen.
No, no, no, I understand that.
I'm just saying that the screen.
Yes.
Oh, the 24 don't have to be premium because they've already got a bigger...
I got a stereo screen as I understand it.
21, 3, 23.
That's what it looks for.
21 to 24.
21 to 2024.
Yes.
Or 2019 to 2024.
But if it's anything below 20, 24, it's got to be a premium.
Okay.
Okay.
So let me...
Let me just...
Let me just...
Let me just...
I'll send you a link of the ones I have.
The ones you have, so I can calculate your taxes.
7106.
1006.
1006.
Okay.
That's right.
It's been moving in.
Jerry, Alkyard, A-L-K-I-R-E.
Okay.
Perfect.
Okay, so...
Just give me a few minutes, and I'll have that information too.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Mm-hmm.
