The great day for our students,
and we are going to do a dog,
because this is a moment
to see us finding a vehicle today.
So, I have a missed call from Ken.
Can you please?
Oh, yeah.
So, let me get you transferred over.
Just let me know it.
I think we can send a question in my turn.
We will.
So, please.
Oh, okay.
So, we're gonna do a dog.
Okay.
Yeah, you're in here.
I'm going to return your call.
Yes.
I really spoke of her eyes.
I have submissions to ask you.
Okay.
I'm going to send you the address.
Let me go back and hurry.
I think you're going to ask me.
And please.
I'm going to go to your boyfriend.
He wouldn't tell me his name.
But I had to want to get clear.
I'm going to be a good friend.
I'm going to be a good friend.
I'm going to be a good friend.
And I'm going to be a good friend.
I'm going to call someone that's being a school party.
I'm going to go back on my way.
I'm going to get a piece of his turn.
I'm going to get a piece of his turn.
I'm going to get a piece of his turn.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to send you back.
I'm going to do it with specific one.
He was interested in it.
It was a 20 minutes.
It was a 20 minutes, 20 call, the 20, 24.
I can't remember which one, but it's because his team, I told him he doesn't miss him.
He has a repo card.
Yeah, he told me the regular credit and the credit.
My credit is not good as it used to be because I have a truck on your mining and then I'm a coal signer and then I have a house under mining as well.
But the thing is the key kind of messed up like great too.
So I saw him and we're never going to get approved.
Okay, well I can do a pre-approval. That's what he was asking for.
And then only thing is, I guess you guys wanted to come and take a look at the truck.
We would do a full credit because we don't want to do a full credit before you all come in.
Only because it does take a hit to your credit.
Yeah.
So we wanted to see if y'all wanted to come and take a look at them first.
So you just see if I get pre-approved, but I don't think we will honestly.
So what he does on that slide is like, I'll try it.
I'll try it.
I'll remind him of the back.
Is it going to be you on the truck or him?
It's going to be, I don't know how he wants it, but I'm going to try it to see if we both can get it, but I don't think that's going to work.
So if you go into my money and like the world, what's supposed to be better credit, what's not ready?
Okay. Can I get his first or my seat?
I will.
You will.
I'm sorry. Can you repeat the last thing for me?
You will.
Okay.
And if you have a long system employee that has reached himself.
Like eight months.
Eight moves.
Okay. And what's the employee name?
I'm the employee name.
I'm not on the person in front of my life.
And then he's working right now for a key one.
Okay.
I might just have to wait until he's able to.
I mean, I tried to do it on the whole work.
So I thought it was a little bit earlier.
You told me to just call you instead.
But notice it is a free approval. That's the information I would need.
Oh, he perfect.
So one hundred.
They are you there.
I will be.
I'll be very good.
So the whole table.
Once I get.
I get on the work and he gets on the work.
I'll go ahead and call you back.
Because I'll be.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes.
Because I have this information.
I don't want to.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
No worries.
I'll be.
I'll be.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
