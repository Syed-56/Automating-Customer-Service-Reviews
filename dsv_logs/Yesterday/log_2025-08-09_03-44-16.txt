Hello, this is Joshua Schottenkirk.
How can I help you?
I'm sorry.
Did you say Joshua?
Yes, sir.
Oh, okay.
Hey, Joshua, my name is Joshua.
I have a question for you.
Yeah, yeah.
Do you guys turn your English English?
We do not turn any read-conditioning fees.
The only thing that we have on all of our vehicles here in New York used is going to
be something called a VIP package.
And it's basically a convenience package we offer to our customers.
And it does have some pretty cool things that offer in the realm of keeping your car in
good shape.
It's basically just like there is a six month or 6,000 mile powertrain warranty as
well as an AC saying time frame.
If it's a new car, you get a key replacement.
If it's a used car, you don't.
There is pain-enhancing, which basically just means like, you know, you get a pain protection
film.
If anything happens to the vehicle, they will come in and use like any type of, you know,
detailing or buffing tools that they would need to.
You get a tire and wheel protection package, which is up to four full replacements on a
tire being a rubber and then four full replacements on the rims.
You get a dame repair and then a windshield repair as well.
And that's automatically attached to the front of the vehicle you're saying.
I'm sorry.
Are you saying that's automatically attached to the price of the vehicle or are you saying
that's an option?
No.
So we add that on any price vehicle we have.
We add that on the package is $1,595 and that is what we add on to the vehicle.
Other than that, it's your standard tax battle license.
So $1,695.
But that's in addition to the price that you see on a line on the vehicle or that's
a part of the car.
Yes.
I listed at the bottom of the listing on our website.
But yes, that is added on to the internet price of the vehicle.
Okay.
So the price that I'm seeing is the price and I already included that.
No.
So it would be, you know, the last thing you're looking at across 20 grand.
It would be $21,695 plus tax battle license.
Okay.
And it's not optional.
You attach it regardless.
So I've seen it remove twice and I've been here about, let's see, about four months.
So, you know, it's very rare.
It does happen.
It just really depends on, you know, what type of vehicle like we have some hell damage
vehicles here.
We obviously have used vehicles that have been here a long time.
But I mean, in the sense of a new car, they're put on all of our new cars and then in
the sense of like something we've recently just gotten there, we're going to be put on
all of our used cars as well.
Yeah.
That's the thing I'm trying to avoid.
I don't need any extras.
I'm pretty approved.
So I'm just looking at you around when I'm in a bin.
Yeah.
I mean, that's only just Joe.
Yeah.
It was a second person.
I actually made the mistake to go into it to a dealership and get it to tell me about the
car.
I know not all of them have it.
And I just walked out because it was ridiculous.
So now I'm calling before I go anywhere.
Yeah.
I'm not here yet.
Yeah.
You guys are far.
I'm in North Fort Worth.
You guys are more than one of those things.
I would want to make a trip over there and have to play some of that in a lot.
Yeah.
I mean, generally speaking, you know, this package is across all of the shot and
perk, you know, like umbrella.
And I mean, we kind of do it in the comparison because I mean, pretty much every dealership
out there is going to have some type of dealer pack or dealer add on that they do.
You know, so we just try to be a little bit more competitive with ours.
Yeah.
My daughter just bought a car and I didn't have those shoes.
I'm doing a ship down the road.
That's why I'm calling before I start making any decisions.
But I didn't bike on a year.
I guess you guys have a point 22, you know, the rest.
And I'm looking at it.
Okay.
Well, do you have a stock number for me?
Uh, pull the bomb car.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's in year 695.
Goodbye.
Yep.
I see you right here.
That's our, I'm just going to see it may have maybe one of the held image units, which
is totally possible.
Um, let me just see here real quick.
No, so it looks like that one's going to be clean.
Um, looks like we picked the car up on the 26th of July was when it was, uh, traded in.
So.
Yeah.
Well, let me.
Yeah.
I know is it when you got when you made sure it is.
I'm sorry.
Well, we'll be trying it in July.
Uh, July 26th.
26th.
Yeah.
Is that have a terminal in it?
Um, so they do.
They're all going to be, um, they're all going to be, what am I trying to say here?
Um, uh, terminal for cylinders.
Um, and then some of the hybrids.
I want to say some of the hybrid models.
Um, don't.
But this one is I'm looking at it.
Is this the hybrid team?
Uh, it is hybrid.
Yeah.
I'm kind of interested.
I'm just telling our documentation and I'm not going to use.
I don't want her to need because.
I'm, uh, my credit union has this thing too that covers all of that.
It just looks like double painted.
They're not struggling before.
But.
Um,
I can't wait.
I can't wait.
Um, well, I'll keep looking around and circle back around.
Yeah.
Let's see if I don't find anything else.
Um, once there's something you got to know working out,
I've got to still want to drive over there.
Yeah.
And I'd love to, you know, and this is like the unfortunate part about it.
You know, I'd love to say that there'd be something I can do.
But I mean, just like I said, I mean, I've seen two times where that, uh,
that package has been removed and I mean, generally speaking,
I just on, on a car, especially this new, like I wouldn't,
I wouldn't see them removing anything.
Um,
Well, I guess it's a different house, right?
Uh, yeah.
No, no, I'm just stopping around.
Yeah.
I'm just stopping around.
Um,
So, um,
If the,
you don't mind asking,
I mean,
I don't know.
Yeah.
I mean,
if they say, yeah,
then you just let me know.
I don't want to waste your time.
Yeah.
One line.
Could I get, uh,
could I get a good name and number just to reach back out?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
I mean,
I,
I'm trying to find,
um,
um,
I don't find something.
And I'll kind of like as far as,
um,
if I can avoid food,
that's going to be the best,
best scenario thing.
Uh,
I don't know if you want to say something like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
but I called you guys because you never know if they charge me that.
I learned my lesson last week,
walking into the toilet and doing a ship and kind of bad experience with them.
Um,
so now I'm calling before I show up anywhere.
Yeah.
I mean,
and that makes sense.
You know,
doing your two diligence prior,
you know,
right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well,
let me know.
Um,
not in a hurry,
but kind of do want to find something quick.
Just to,
yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I guess whatever it's meant to have a little happen.
So in terms,
and I'm only asking because they're asking me this,
um,
in terms of if I could get the package removed,
are you okay with the advertised price of 27, 8, 12?
Um,
I mean,
I think right now,
um,
just a little bit.
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think that would be good.
I'm just,
I'm talking about,
I'm not,
you know,
um,
I've been a few partners in this region, too.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean,
that makes sense.
I'm just curious.
Yeah,
cause they'll ask me,
and you know,
if it's something that you are comfortable with,
there's a better chance that they'll work with us on it.
You know,
I mean,
if you're like,
you know,
I'm pretty approved,
and the advertised price is fine.
I just want to pay the advertised price.
You know,
it's kind of a better ballpark,
but I mean,
you know,
obviously, if you were like,
you know,
gosh,
I want to be a,
you know,
27 on a TV,
like that's,
and that's something that's just not going to happen.
So that's why I was kind of like,
kind of poking a camera head to that.
Yeah,
well,
I mean,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think,
I think that's a plan on the day.
I've asked you the question,
what's possible, right?
And,
I mean,
I'm approved for whatever,
but I'm trying to keep this,
and within a certain budget,
because I have to buy two cars,
not just one.
Yeah,
see you looking for a truck also.
Okay.
I don't know.
You guys have trucks there.
I haven't even looked for her.
I'm just looking for me right now,
because that's kind of more of a plan already,
but she's not really pre-approved too.
Yeah,
I mean,
we do have plenty of trucks,
just adding that in there.
I mean,
you know,
I would definitely
popping on our website,
which,
I mean,
I can text you a link to it if you want.
Yeah,
that's a really kind of,
uh,
just a channel,
almost aren't specific.
I know.
Cars,
but I know you guys are,
you probably have a dealer site, right?
Yeah,
we do.
Yes, sir.
And it'll show,
it'll show every,
or every dealership under the shot and Kirk,
um,
name.
So that includes,
you know,
the one at what a firm,
there's one in Grandbury,
there's a shot and Kirk,
and Prosperer,
that's a Jeep Dodge Ram.
Um,
you know,
there's like five different dealerships in there.
That will show every vehicle that is available.
Um,
but I can have them.
Yeah,
but I can have them.
Yeah,
but they have a,
a grand Cherokee,
a point,
yeah.
What's the big,
big mermaids know that?
She seems pretty,
that.
And so,
um,
about finding something,
that I'll show to you,
I'll talk to you about it,
but I mean,
I would ask for you,
and just just case the area,
right?
Without me having to do it,
uh,
back and forth,
or whatever,
just out of really want to add,
whatever.
If you give me your best case scenario,
I mean,
we go from there,
and then we'll see,
you know,
yeah,
yeah,
okay,
jump in,
you can shoot me a link over.
I'll take a look
and then show my life
and I'll find anything else.
Okay.
Okay.
And I'm sorry,
tell me,
tell me,
tell me more time.
My name's Joshua.
Joshua,
okay.
Thanks, Joshua.
Be a sure.
I appreciate it.
I appreciate it.
Alrighty.
Bye.
Bye.
