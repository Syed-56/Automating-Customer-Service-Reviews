Hello, this is Laura from Holman Honda. How can I help you? Yep. Hello. My name is Harrison and I am looking at
Selling my 2009 Honda Accord
Okay, awesome. You're your name is Harrison. Yeah, okay perfect
Awesome, sorry. You're writing that down really quick. I'm memory is fun sometimes
Yeah, let's see. Yeah, 2009 Honda Accord
I do have some time today if you want to bring it by and we can do an evaluation of it and see what we can offer you
Yeah, but I do like a question
first because I need to figure out if I can even sell it because technically I just might be like a lot
So try to bear with me, but I
I'm under my mom's name right and
The part is also registered in Minnesota because that's what my parents live and I just moved here last year
And I recently got another car
And I'm looking at trying to sell this one and I do have the title and my mom signed it and she mailed it to me
or the Honda and it is a
Minnesota state title
and the like buyers
stuff
So like the transferring that's all blank so that can be sold out by anyone but like these
selling parts is filled out
So can I even sell the car or would you have to be here present with me?
So what I can do and this is something that I actually just said recently is
Week can have your mom is this just your mom?
Yeah, my mom. Okay. Perfect. So what we could do is we can have her
Everify herself so I'll send her a link and she'll just upload a picture of her driver's license
so that we do have a
photo at least verification of who we think we're dealing with
And then I can actually make if we do come to an agreement on the price I can make a
packet for you and
We can send it to her and then she can FedEx it to us overnight and then
With her permission. We can make probably make the tracking your name. I'll have to double check that to check
Might have to be in her name
But I mean you guys are family social just give it to you right?
So yeah, so yeah, that's pretty much what I could do is yeah, if you want to bring this title
We come through an agreement
Everify who she is and then we can send her the paperwork and then she can send it back to us
And I'll make sure that we have
Pre-paid postage on the envelope set nothing coming out of her pocket to do that too
Okay, cool. Yeah, awesome. Yeah, mix it. Hopefully a little less stressful for you
Yeah, that's because I don't want her to have to fly out here
And I don't also didn't want to have to like drive it 10 hours up
Just having felt it and whatever but yeah, right. No absolutely
Sometimes it gets it complicated and you're like why?
Well, awesome. Yeah, I mean, yeah, so if you have time and if that all sounds good, I can see
Who we should release the truck to it might have to be your mom, but I can definitely double check that and if you have time
I come by today or tomorrow. I'd love to help you out
Okay, yeah, I'm gonna
What I need to get home appointment because I don't know if all be there today or tomorrow or next weekend or whatever
I just kind of show up or
It is better to schedule an appointment because sometimes we do get really busy and I would hate for you to have to sit around for like an hour or so
So if you want to call like you and if you just want to call ahead and give us the heads up like really hey
You know, I'm about like 30 minutes out then we can probably shuffle some things around and make sure someone's available for you
