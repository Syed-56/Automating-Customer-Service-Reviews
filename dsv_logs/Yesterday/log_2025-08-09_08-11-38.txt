Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Optimum RV.
This is useful. No one around may help you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You need to talk to the dairy.
One moment I'll put you through to him.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. Connor, it will be just a moment here with someone, okay?
Okay.
I think we'll call out tomorrow.
Are you the situation ones of yours?
Hi there, assistant.
Hey, Jason.
How you doing?
Alright.
So what feedback did you get from the phone?
So what I heard from Sean is that they liked the Cougar.
They didn't like the grand design because it pushed them out.
And then the pumas that you suggested were too big because it grand kids.
Okay.
Well, I mean, you know, I definitely will just point it.
I felt like looking on the website, you guys had a whole lot of a lot of, you know, kind of 40 cars and 40,000,
and I think it was about the less trailers there that I think would work for them that were thinking of some travel trailers.
I was texting them some travel trailers to look at everything.
What do you think of it?
If I had known that you were looking for travel tours, well, because I remember you said six wheels and destination, that was the only things that you said.
So that's why I kind of stuck them with those ones.
If you're looking for travel trailers and everything, I'm more than happy to show you all some travel trailers off in them your way.
That way you can kind of decide first on which are like there and then whenever you got ready to come out and actually see and you can come out and see the ones that you're like.
Yeah.
I was trying to work out in the blind sight with us to do this.
And so, you know, I can send it to areas you want to send it to where they can not be at all?
No.
Okay.
No, that makes us no.
And the reason I was trying to keep them down there in the 40s is they're freaking out enough at 40.
He took him into a 55 miles lower trailer and they took off running like a dump stomping with a hot iron.
Yeah.
And so, yeah, it was the sting that was so I told him not to tell him about any of the pranks of it all because you had said something about me.
Yeah.
And I was like, okay, that's around the same.
It's actually cheaper than the boom is that we have here.
I was like, it didn't work.
Yeah.
So yeah, like I said, I, whenever you gave me the introduction to I relate to the same instructions.
Yeah.
No, no.
Yeah.
Well, that's not the only line freaking out at 50, you got $1,000 and everything.
And they're like, oh, you can't depend there.
How would you, we just had to leave.
We just had to get out of there because it just has too much money.
And it's like, God damn it.
I have to write.
I have to write a few questions.
I write a few questions.
Because I did not.
You know, okay.
Yeah.
I write a few questions.
I'm going to have a quick, quick conversation because that's that.
Yeah.
It is what it is.
So we have a, you know, I mean, I think at least the good news is that they get like the teaser.
They, they, they are, they're freaked out enough.
But, but at least I got them, got them looking at something.
And yeah.
And so now they're quite frankly there's your competition right now.
Look in the, in their, in their, their, their selling against you.
Yeah.
It's the part.
You know, you know how it works.
Yeah.
So, so I'll, I'll wait and see where that.
I mean, I know this teaser is, you know, the trigger is in line with, and, you know, the whole backstory to all of this is they.
We had a trailer for them that.
That we were by and they didn't know what it was going to cost and all that other stuff.
And, but they were.
You know, there's an individual deal not to be aware of anything like that.
Yeah.
And it ended up to, there's then somebody else heard that they were selling it and then they sold it out from under.
And so we're trying to, you know, do something on the sneakier and, and, as well, keep them, even, of what anything.
Yeah, you're trying to do right.
But, yeah.
So, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, we'll, we'll write the best out over here.
See what we can come up with.
And I mean, that's what we're doing.
The give me the, the, the trigger is very similar to the unit that, that we were getting them.
The thing it's seen and they were really excited about.
So, we'll, we'll kind of see where the rest of the day goes and what, what things do you work.
So, this is the end of this week.
So, next week, the days that I am off, I'm off Thursday and Sunday, next week.
And turn after that, I go back to my weekend off.
So, it kind of alternates.
So, I do one weekend off and then the Thursday from the day off.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, this weekend, so today's your last day working this week.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, I think that's the first week.
If you're more than welcome to text me, I do still answer my phone.
Working because that's nature of sales.
Yeah.
But yeah.
Yeah.
If you have any questions, anything text me?
Okay.
If you have any ideas of, of the cameras that you, you think that you might like, or that they might
like, let me know.
I'll write down or put in the notes at least.
So, that's it.
So, that's it in mind, whatever.
If we do anything.
Okay.
Sure.
Well, it's perfect.
We'll see what's up, that's all this.
And I'll send you a text.
I mean, if I end up deciding that we want to do something on the, on the paper, I'll, I'll see
you a text and we can jump in there.
Alright.
I appreciate you very much.
Thank you for sending everyone down.
Alright.
