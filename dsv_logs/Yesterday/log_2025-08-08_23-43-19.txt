Hi, I just read your email.
I'm sure I'm glad that worked out and absolutely you can take some of the stuff you want
with the best.
Thank you.
I love the best.
That's the best part.
That's the best part.
That's the best.
That's the best.
I love good.
And I'll reply back to that email if you'd like to answer all those questions.
But the first thing we want to do, if you're okay with this, we want to take a deposit.
Okay.
ASAP.
That way we get marked the car sold.
Take it off the lot.
We can do that with a debit or credit whatever is easier for you.
Oh, yeah, I can do a...
I can do a...
What am I saying?
I can do a...
Am I trying to car?
Okay.
Cool.
We'll do a there will be a thousand and then that will come off the total.
Or if you want that back on your car, when you pick the car, we can put it back on your
card.
Um, actually...
Mmm.
We allow for two thousand on a card if you want.
Just so you know some people like to get their points.
So even a five.
So it was never a five hundred dollar deposit.
It was a five.
With assets always a thousand.
Yeah.
Okay.
So let me know.
I see.
Thanks.
Yeah.
I just want to give you a check.
Is that okay?
Or do you have my call?
Whatever you want.
Um, if you wanted, I mean, I'm sure if you want to do the five hundred on the card, I can...
I can make that happen.
That would be a little bit better for me because this is coming out of another account.
Yeah.
Let's see that.
Uh, that's what I'm going to make.
I'm going to make that happen.
I don't want to add that sign.
I don't want the mix up.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That way.
Okay.
All right.
That one's going to come.
Yeah.
All right.
That one's going to come.
Yeah.
All right.
That one's going to come.
All right.
So, um, the window's hit.
I'll probably get that set up.
Um, the window's hit.
Um, ideally for a Monday or Tuesday.
I'm going to get with my inventory manager to find out.
Uh, what's your, what's your availability this coming week to so I can try to time everything good for us?
Oh, let's see.
Oh, oh, gosh.
Okay.
We're going to see 11.
Um, get back.
I need to.
Good Monday.
And I'm good to do.
Yeah.
We will most likely work go at my guests because they don't, um, they don't do window tint or anything on, um, Saturdays.
And it's, uh, too late in the van, fortunately at this point to have them do it.
Okay.
Wednesday is probably going to be best if that's okay for you when Sarah Thursday.
That way we have time to get the window tint done.
Um, we get the full detail.
We get that little rubber piece six.
I just want to make sure they have enough time to get everything done.
Okay.
So the day is fine.
So it's okay.
I would be, um, yeah, I'm fine.
All the.
That's okay.
That's okay.
That's okay.
Let's do Thursday.
Yeah, the I'd rather everything get done right rather than rush it.
Um, Thursday.
Let's see.
They have the calendar blocked off from nine to 11 with no deliveries then.
So we can do any time.
Um, after 11.
Whatever works best for you.
Yeah.
Let's do one.
One.
Three.
One o'clock on the 14.
And if for whatever reason.
I know.
I know.
If for some reason.
Um, I mean, I'm crossing my fingers.
I don't see why we can't get the get everything done by them.
But for whatever reason, the window tip people are like completely backed up or whatever reason.
I will let you know.
But I think we're I think we're safe with Thursday.
Um, and.
So that gives you the detailing and all that stuff now.
Um, so they, they won't be able to do it right this moment.
They're going to wait until, um, closer to delivery just so it is clean as possible.
We want them to do the repair first.
Okay.
Um, just because it'll of course get driven from here down to service and we want the car to look as clean as possible.
Um, usually they kind of wait to do the detail until.
the last minute, but because you're getting window tip, um, they're going to have to account for that too.
Um, because it's you don't want to of course wash the car.
You know, get the window top.
Oh, right.
Okay.
So you're at.
Um, and that's okay.
That's okay.
Um, but it just takes a little bit more planning just to make sure everything's done properly.
Now, can I just ask one more thing and answer could be no.
Yeah.
Um, if you were to call the 10th people to say hey, did you squeeze it in and have it ready by Tuesday?
Did that too much or not?
I didn't want to get out of like that.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I'll try.
Like I said, I don't know for certain until, um, until I talked to my inventory manager who handles all of that.
Um, everything's done off site.
So it's a matter of availability and what not.
And their schedule and you know, I bet I know I love you to leave with the car today if you could.
I know.
I know.
I know.
They're probably like here.
See now, not that we got.
Yeah.
Very.
I'm like.
I don't blame you.
I'm a student in the universe.
Like maybe those new things.
Yeah.
I'm going to try.
I'm going to try.
I don't give up easy.
So I'll try my best for you.
Let's think what else.
Oh, let me.
Let me.
I'm going to put you on hold for a super quick second.
If that's okay.
And let my manager know that I'm taking your deposit.
I'm going to make sure the 500 is okay.
Okay.
All right.
Give me one moment.
Sure.
Yeah.
Thank you.
See here when this time rolled around.
We sent the spirit of new here at Germain that also includes the all new West Bank.
Germain Express dot com.
You can now shop all 11 of our family on dealerships in Columbus right on the web.
The convenience begins as soon as you land on the homepage.
Just enter what you're looking for to search our new and piano design stories of Lord
Nissan Mazda, Lexus, Lincoln, Subaru, Kia, Hyundai, Toyota, and Volkswagen.
Okay, we're good. I just wanted to run it by him for a while.
He said that is totally fine. Let's do it.
And then painting a prize, of course, that 500 week, whenever you come pick up the car,
we can always put it back on your card, or whatever you prefer.
You can just, um,
Yeah, I probably hear you back on the card.
Okay, so whenever you come in, bring your card with you.
We don't keep the card info on file, so we'll just need the actual card
or the card number whenever you come back in.
Um, just make sure that with you that day.
Mm-hmm.
All right, I am ready whenever you are.
If is...
I would really lose my head.
What do you got?
I would do.
Okay, okay.
Oh, that's what it is.
Oh, that's what it is.
Mm-hmm.
Five times.
Yeah.
All right. I'll run it for the 500.
I will send you a copy of the receipt.
And then let me see if there's any questions that you answered that I need to cover with you on the phone.
Um, I'll let you know, you're paying cash cash, right? You're not financing.
No, yeah, cash.
Okay.
Um, I want to be able to be secured.
It'll be secured until you can pick it up whenever.
Yeah.
I'll put me in the face.
Yeah.
I'll pay you that.
Yeah, once we have the deposit, we're basically, yeah, we're good.
Yeah, I went in here and I'll find that out full detail repair.
I will find that out.
Um, okay.
So the Audi, is it just registered in your name?
Um, okay.
Well, let me send you the, oh, yeah.
We can transfer your plate.
Yep.
As long as you have a current registration, that's just in your name.
Um, yeah.
We can transfer the plate.
We'll handle all that for you here.
Um, well, the title for the new vehicle be mailed.
We will mail it to you.
Well, if not, wait the state or other.
Yep.
You will get everything in the mail.
You'll get your new registration in the mail, your new title of the mail.
Um, so basically once you leave here, you won't, you shouldn't have to go to the B&V or anything.
Everything will be done.
Oh, okay.
And I don't have to, uh, hold this one a question.
And I bring you my, my title and my two key Bob.
Yes.
Yep.
You're going to bring in, um, I'll, I can either text that or email.
I'll give you a short list of things that I'll want to make sure you have with you.
Um, but it'll include, yeah, your title, your registration, any current insurance card.
Mm-hmm.
Of course, your check.
The social key says it trade in, but like I said, I'll send this all to you just since everything's accounted for.
Um, and the insurance for, because I'm going to, when I come make sure I add it before I drive it off.
Why do you need my insurance?
Sure.
Um, so we need any current insurance card to send to the state to let them, to show that you are insured.
It, it doesn't matter what vehicle it's for.
It could be for the new card.
It could be for the one that you're trading in.
As long as we have something that shares you have a current policy.
Oh, okay.
So when I put the card on the view, you can have that one.
Yeah, that's fine.
Yep.
As long as it'll just be effective of whatever day we set, you know, it can't be effective the next day.
Of course, it has to be effective.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Exactly.
You don't need like old users.
Uh, we, yeah, we honestly, we could use your old one.
It doesn't matter because the policy number actually stays the same.
All the state is looking at is that you have a current policy number that you are the person
insured that it's not under someone else's name.
In order to title the car, that's all they look at.
Because technically with your insurance, you have a grace period to add the vehicle to your
policy.
I'm like, use those a day that I leave with the car.
I like to add it.
I want it to be done that day.
Yeah.
I want to take the other one off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Um, two things.
Uh, because I'm, I'm going to try my best to make Tuesday happen.
What time of day would be best for you?
We can use two things over there.
Um,
Morning's a great but all day.
It's fine.
Okay.
I'll say morning would be wonderful.
Morning or new or.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll do the best.
And then last thing, um, I had my business manager give me a couple of quotes for the warranty.
Um, and I can put that in email as well, but just for at least verbally give it to you.
I had him do a two year and a three year option.
Um,
He said those are typically the best for pricing.
And two years is 24, 45, three years is 28, 45.
Um, and I'll put those in the email as well.
And that takes an after the second to you.
Exactly.
Yep.
Okay.
That's just for longer.
Yep.
Bumper bumper.
Everything but where in here.
But your bumper to bumper includes your power trade.
So bumper to bumper is everything but where in
Terrydoms are like windshield wipers, breaks, rotors, tires.
Yeah.
Um, you know, those types of things.
Bumper bumper is going to include your power train, which is your engine transmission drive axle.
Plus, electronic technology, your touch screen, your AC, your backup camera.
You know, all of the anything power related.
Um,
the key to the cool.
What not is all going to be covered.
Cause that warranty is essentially everything.
That's what they call they call a bumper to bumper.
Cause it's pretty much everything other than where in Terrydoms.
Okay.
And as far as that goes, you of course you do not have to decide that right now.
Okay.
But that in the email and then you can let us know the day of.
Okay.
Perfect.
Yep.
Look at everything.
And both front pins would mess the back, right?
Yes.
Yep.
And unless you want the front to be lighter for some reason, but those people will do the front to match the back.
Yeah.
I want to match.
I think it looks the cleanest.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm closing.
Yeah.
Okay.
And then just last.
And when they're doing the, yeah, the roof here is it.
And I think they'll do the thorough job.
But there was some white wearing hair.
Unlike the doors and the seat.
I'm assuming they would get all of that.
Yeah.
They're going to do their, they're going to do their best to get the car looking as clean and new as possible.
Yeah.
And whenever you pick the car up, like I said, I like to look over the whole vehicle with you while you're here just to make sure you're happy with what you see.
All right.
Awesome.
Thank you.
Hey.
You are so welcome.
Congratulations.
I will go get your deposit ran.
I'm going to get that car off the lot.
And everybody looks at it.
And I'll be saying you can hear that.
Oh, that's what I'm going to do.
That's what I'm going to do.
It's going to hang up.
All right.
Thank you.
All right.
I'll do a lot of work.
Okay.
With that.
Hopefully I'll see you too.
I'm just looking at you.
I know.
So I'm going to, I'm going to try to get all this done for us right now.
And I'll let you do a task.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay.
Thanks.
Bye.
