Good morning, Portia Parks and there will be.
I'm just going to see what the problem is.
Oh, I am, or...
I know the voice.
I was going to be.
What was going on?
I'm glad you know my voice got there and it's shit.
I'm just trying to go on so far.
I should get out of here in my public box.
Five o'clock.
Yes, five o'clock.
I'll be happy of...
I'll be happy with that.
That's a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell.
What's it got for it for the Wooty?
I'm not going to be asking you about it.
My brother is actually in town so I'm going to be hanging out with him for the next few days
until he heads back out.
What's going on?
Where you come from?
Where you come from?
Where you come from?
Where you come from?
I'm pretty.
Oh, okay, okay?
Yeah.
I'm coming.
I was on your website and I actually look in that shoe.
I was like, okay, he looks like he has an accent.
I didn't want to just say it and be...
I like he's very deep on the island somewhere.
Look at that picture.
I was like, and in your name, I was like, that's in the way it's filled.
I'm like, he may be from the island.
I didn't want to say that, but I kind of thought so.
I definitely thought the island's beautiful.
I thought he was about...
Yeah.
How long have you been here?
I've been here.
It's about 20.
About 25.
And then he found, oh, God damn.
This is...
Hey, we're gonna sit up for you last time.
I'm about 20, so about 20, 70 years I've been here.
I've been here as a kid.
Okay, so I'm about to go.
I'm gonna move to Minnesota when I was 11 and I'm 45.
All right, right, right.
Okay, so yeah.
So, we're very excited.
Everybody say I'm a median.
I'm a median.
This is...
You're your one?
They say I'm a median.
So, I'll still have a straggo.
I'll put it like, okay, now you're trying to get good.
You're trying to get good and good at the same time.
I said, yeah.
I hear that.
I started to move.
You know, when you go to your parents and make you move, so my mother made me repair when she's
when I was little.
And literally, I moved up here, 11.
And I still have 10,000, and I'm still playing with my sister,
and I'm going to go back up here when I was 25.
And then that's everything.
Like that's the time.
And it's definitely like that sometimes.
I mean, it's nothing.
And you are a new father.
So, you're gonna learn the truth and the phrase,
I love you here.
I got the trip chain.
This 21 year old, 21 just called me the other day.
And I said, I'm about to move next month.
I said, what if he said the other school?
I said, what if he said for my game?
I said for your game?
Yeah.
I said, I'm about to move on the 31st of this month.
Do you think I got to go for a game?
Are you serious?
Yeah.
And he was very serious.
I know they're there.
They only care about what they need.
That's usually how we go.
I don't like to eat.
You're worried about what you want.
It's not what you need.
Because what you need ain't what you want.
You're right there.
You're right there.
Everybody's got to explain it.
I was asking for something else.
I was asking for something else.
Nothing else.
It's not something else.
It's not something else.
But I was gonna ask, yeah, we're gonna like,
are you going to stop surprise or path?
Well, they kind of have more parts,
but they kind of have like the vendors already automatically
come here. But what kind of stuff we talking about?
I was asking if we could do something because I know your
poor and I know poor sure they be one they share to say
poor sure? A lot of it, a lot of it.
Because you guys have deals on the like the place
there's also the gloves.
Less than three screws are funny because I
have two vendors, one vendor, once I
received it, it was not to the tech's
liking so that I went back to their results under. I don't know what the
difference in the screw is but they came right back so
fast. So looking at it, I wasn't really able to tell
what I just said was one vendor on that because I
don't want any issues. But what other
kind of stuff do you have? Do you have like a catalog or like maybe some options?
But you can like sit over and email like it's like a look at it.
We do have a website we can go look at.
We do have on the website. I know your poor
controls, you know, I can see it in the door.
The first process I'll be waiting more for is a
stock supply.
My own physical look, I'll go look into what I can and can't do.
What's the website?
That's ari.
I'm in.
You got calm.
I actually saw you on one of my business cards as well
for this. It's on there as well.
You saw this card.
You up with the next one, you up with the visa and everything.
You know what I'm saying?
The box is literally sitting next to me and it was built into
the empty box.
I just had the empty box.
I'm on the site now.
We plan to get up out of here early on.
I know how to have me.
I'm like, will you do go on?
It's the hit.
I'm going to pull up my card.
When you go on the website, if you see something on there and
you know, you're paying a different deal.
Of course, I'll work with you on that.
We all work out.
I'm looking at this going on.
I'm looking at the site and I go to shop.
When I'm on the shop, I only see one thing.
It says the universal contract contract.
Great ads.
I don't see anything else.
On the website.
Mm-hmm.
There have you been on the website.
If you're saying he doesn't see any, it's like nothing on the
stock price on the website.
Besides some price.
I'm just browsing for the site.
What type of software are you like looking for or thinking?
No, I want to see what you have.
So, you know, I'll see the build and pass it.
I do.
But I use that.
I'm just trying to figure what else you want to options that there's.
I'm not going to put the money.
You know, whenever you put on the spot, you can never think about.
Excuse me, brother.
How are you doing?
I'm a rare either.
I'm doing a fair force.
Where man, I'll be better when I can get out of here.
That's my boss, Daisy.
Ah, fuck.
I just want to say you're a poor stealer, right?
Okay.
Okay.
Well, we deal with lots of high end emissions like yourselves.
Mostly what we deal with those guys are like paper or poly floor mats, seat covers,
wiper blades, gloves, take that.
That's sort of the kind of job time.
What kind of glove we have to ask for black.
We have two types.
We have the black six mill nitro powder free.
We also have the nine mill diamond grip nitro and powder free.
That's coming both the right how much of those.
Right now they're actually on sale.
They're just 23.95 a box for the orange nitro, nine mill.
And that's all sizes.
Small to extra extra large.
What size do you normally use?
Probably medium and large more than medium and large.
Okay.
And then I tell you what boss, I'll make you a deal.
If you can do three cases of medium and three cases of large, I'll toss you in a case for free.
You can choose which one you want to free.
Where did that be?
Medium or.
How many gloves coming about?
Oh, well, in one block, there's a hundred and one case, there's ten box.
So one case is ten boxes.
So a case of glove has been around the how much?
Twenty three ninety five for a box.
So that's two thirty nine and fifty cents.
And we'll take care of the shipping for you.
I don't know.
I don't know.
He's fifty thirty nine.
Who's thirty nine fifty?
Let me just make sure that's right.
Yeah, two thirty nine fifty.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, I don't use the hours when I use the regular, the white gloves.
What's the price on the white gloves?
Well, we carry black nitro with six milli powder free.
And right now we're doing them at twelve bucks a box.
Yeah, right now.
So roughly, we're long the same.
I think I'm getting it from my vendor at eleven.
Okay, that's still not that price off.
But it's not the same.
Well, I do the for you.
I'll do my ten bucks.
Okay, that's more.
That's a bit of bargain.
But I would say this though.
You guys, I just placed an order with my vendor.
So I don't need any more gloves right now.
But I would keep being a holder, being yellow.
The name of people number.
So the next order that I placed out of our order, do you guys?
If you ask it out.
Okay.
Because I'm a little bit of a daughter.
I just got my order last week.
Oh, no, kids are there there.
I arrived yet.
You know, no, I placed it.
I came in like very next day.
So I think the last week, Monday, I placed the order and I received it by Tuesday.
It's not Wednesday.
I received it.
I received it.
So I'm currently all okay.
Dr.
How many people?
No, I picked up.
How many boxes?
I think it was like four boxes.
I think that.
Also, so like two cases of each order or whatnot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think it was two cases.
It's not.
It could have been five because I think I got extra logs.
But it's like maybe one or two guys that you've extra large.
So I think I got one box extra log until everything else.
Also on the next go around.
I don't mind a placement order, which you guys.
Okay.
That's fair enough.
What else do you pick up outside of the gloves?
Do you do any of the seat covers or floor mats?
Oh, no.
I mean, we used to do it with the Porsche provided one.
Not the, uh, the nerds.
Okay.
So I mean, like just a disposable one.
You know.
Yeah.
That's the one I'm talking about.
That we don't know.
Oh, he's covered the face cover.
Even our floor covers had Porsche on it.
Oh, no.
Okay.
Yeah.
All right.
We'll give it to the nerds.
Oh, okay.
Fair enough.
Fair enough.
So then basically we're, we're, we're at gloves from time to time.
Uh, CR 2013.
I mean, sometimes.
Yeah.
Uh, I don't mind.
I don't mind.
I'm not the problem that I have another problem that I have.
I could like slowly work, which you guys, but from that I have is this is a company that I have.
They have approved vendors that they like to use for their products.
So you see how you save me a couple of dollars with the gloves.
Like all right.
So then the one off that I do, they would, you know, kind of, they'll understand why.
You understand what I'm saying?
Well, I'm not really happy.
I'm not really happy.
So the, the auto group that the auto group that we're with, we have about five, six
billion years.
We all are approved vendors that we use to order from now.
Okay.
Me strain away from our approved vendors.
I could say like, hey, listen, I straight away because we saved money here and you know,
it's more it's, it's an easy field to fall.
Oh, no, I get it.
Yeah, for sure.
I'm thinking I was related now.
Well, yeah.
Well, definitely.
We always want to try to create a win, win, win, you know.
I'm right.
Maybe we do it.
Maybe we do it.
It won't, well, well, if everything goes well, you know, maybe we can start adding you on to different,
you know, yeah, I'm not an assistant store.
Oh, that would be great.
Ah, right.
Yeah.
We definitely be open.
it out.
I mean, if we have consistent distributors as well, so the products you get will be the product
that you always get.
And it's high quality.
So you won't have any problem with that.
And anytime we make an offer, we stand by yourself.
When you are ready to do the gloves, it's just 10 bucks a box for you.
Is there any way that you can do it?
If extra large today, just that way, that way you'll see what you're going to get in them.
No, I already have.
I'm already over the stock.
I have my stock and my self-esteem and I have two extra boxes sitting on top of the show.
All right.
Fair enough.
Well, I want you to give you a call back.
I'd say, maybe towards the end of the month or things are already next month.
I should be ready to person of the order.
Okay.
All right.
Well, we'll have to know you're back with you at the end of the month.
Just stick your head in the door, say aye.
And if you're ready, we'll fire away.
If not, just have a call you back at whatever time in the beginning of September at work
for you.
All right.
Sounds great.
All right, my brother.
Thank you very much.
You have one for this.
You have one for that.
