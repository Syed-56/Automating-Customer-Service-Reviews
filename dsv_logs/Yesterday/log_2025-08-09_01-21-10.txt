Thanks for calling me with Toyota.
This is Steve and I'm talking to you.
Hey Steve, how you doing?
I'm Thomas here in Denver.
Hey, I'm calling him to start to do for shopping.
Steve for a new plug-in hybrid and looking at your guys' rap boards and comparing
him to the board of Steve, I was just looking at which I prefer Toyota, but they're
a bit lower on the price scale and there's some changes that we based
on in the commercial.
I just wanted to call and see what you can tell me about pricing for anything you have
on the lot.
It's going to be on our lot in the next month or so.
Yeah, you said it was for your comparing sheet at with cheaper?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I'd prefer it to be cheaper by a long stop.
Let's see here.
You're looking for a TV plug-in hybrid or like a pre-is plug-in hybrid?
No, I'm looking at the rap board.
Right, right.
You said that.
Okay, let's see here.
Let's go to rasp4.
Two.
Four.
Four.
Yeah, we got some common.
In the starting out around $50,000.
See here.
And did you know that you want to rasp4 plug-in hybrid yet?
Or are you kind of just comparing Apple storage at this point?
Yeah, I'm comparing Apple's oranges with Gotta.
That's Toyota.
It's most of my life.
I'm going to go to hot and go to 10 years old that I'm looking to get to the next
days on and I know I want.
Yeah, the plug-in hybrid is key factor for me to be sure to be interested in right now.
So I don't want to pre-it.
So I'm looking at the rap board because of that.
Yeah, no problem.
Let me see here.
Do you always have your timeline?
It's not urgent.
I mean, I want to start by this September.
So I see a little federal rebates for pretty expire.
So that's I got about a month.
Gotcha.
Yeah, for sure.
Well, if you want something to remember, now would be the time to kind of put how do you
say, get your name on one of them.
Most of these guys sell before they get here.
So if you have time, I'd love for you to come in sometime and go over the allocation process with us.
Okay.
How does this work?
I know there's some of these dealers that are like, hey, this is it.
You know, we don't negotiate or other, but still do.
Where do you guys at?
I'm trying to look at pricing because you're going to 50 to that.
I'm going to put the room you have on there, whether through my trading or.
Yeah, what are you guys looking at in terms of that?
Sure.
Yeah, I appreciate that.
First off, I can see the first question.
Well, I'll tell you on Broadway.
I can send you a correct address.
And then to get here, second question, we like to put our best look forward and on.
The equals that we're typically getting it.
It's time for us to usually be equal that we have a lot of like a time to come up.
Do you feel better kind of pre sold before they get here or a little harder to, you know, this town.
But I mean, if it's over a couple hundred bucks, we wouldn't leave you over, you know, small amount of money.
But usually when it's, you know, you know what I'm saying?
They're selling before they get here.
I would give them the more detailed.
They negotiate on price like that.
So we're trying price on this cheapest possible, so then to sell.
Okay.
Let me see what I can do to get in there and see if you guys did take one of these up for the texture.
Gotcha.
So we don't have any on the lock.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kind of a rare commodity here.
Let me see if you have any used ones that share the same power train.
So we'll have a, let's see, kind of like a 2022 hybrid to test that kind of the
zero for, but none currently on the log. Okay.
I guess if it is something, you know you're going to need a September. I think we have some arriving
for a dealership in September, but you kind of got to get your name on one of them to receive one.
Okay. Well, let me think about it then. Keep writing it in there to start to process this with you if I make that call between that, you know, the next week or so.
Okay, cool. Do you have any things that you'd be off or you'd be knowing how I can make it in that day so I can sit in the appointment?
Or, you know, you aren't sure yet. Yeah, I'm going to play by you. Okay. No problem. We'll take time and thank you for your time. We appreciate you and I hope to see you soon.
All right, take care. I'll come there.
