Thank you for calling DCH Smart Claire Ocura. Please hold while we connect you to the next available team member.
This call is being recorded.
I see H. Mancler Accure Ad, is it sales?
Yes, I was calling this digital drain yellow.
Open one moment.
Sure.
Please hold while I try to connect you.
Thank you for calling DCH Smart Claire.
I see this is the nearest team member.
Hi, Deyolo.
This is Cushanger.
You call me back earlier.
I love the message.
Yeah.
I just wanted to inform that I spoke with my managers.
It looks like that vehicle is in stock.
So, whomever was buying it, but they placed it the positive,
because on our spreadsheet, it showed that it was sold.
It could have just been a situation with insurance,
or they just could not move forward with the monthly payments on the car.
So, it is available in up-to-graphs if you're selling it.
See, I'm a little in-res extent.
I mean, even though I'm in the market, I'm a little bit hesitant about the car
and the dealership processes now because I mean, here's my thing.
I called over the period of last month at least two times
and spoke with two different people.
And when I posted again with them twice being changed,
I called back and they told me under, you know,
there was loads out that it was a dumb deal.
So, I'm like, what's the real story behind this car?
Was it sold, taken off the lot, dropped that?
Like, what is really the deal?
No, yours. I live in Brooklyn and I'm coming to, if I come out there, I'm coming to far away.
And I don't want to waste my time either.
No, that's completely understandable.
Yeah, I know you've been crying for the vehicle since last month
and then we had made an appointment, but then I looked like correct.
On the 17th, you have spoken with my other colleagues.
It showed up in the unit, get half of the deposit,
so then I informed you on the situation as well.
And then I'm on the main floor because of the vehicle still on our website.
And because it was showing that the project, the weren't able to move forward.
And then afterwards, now, since I have you on my spread to call out,
I'm looking at the vehicle's details.
So, I called you to just see if you're still looking for a car
or you might be interested in this one because we do have this vehicle back.
So, when you call, I thought you were talking about a new 2025,
not this one because obviously I was told it had a yellow marker on it
and that meant that it was a button done deal.
So, of course, I'm going to be thinking that would be the case.
Which is that.
But yeah, it does look like when you were spoken to some other colleagues,
the vehicle had a deposit on it.
So, once it was a deposit, it usually means that it's done deal.
But since the vehicle was back, that's where I don't know what this situation
could be with a client.
So, it couldn't afford the car.
Situations when it comes down with insurance wise, but we do have the car back.
I mean, you said you find out, so it never left a lot.
It wasn't or anything like that.
Like you're going to find out.
So, you can go over here at the law.
Once you don't have insurance, we are not allowed to let the vehicle go.
And then, I mean, just trying to think it turns over.
and trying to come out to the now because, you know,
I had known this before it'd be easier during the week.
You try to say, you seem like we're set up.
Maybe we could set up an appointment for tomorrow.
Yeah.
So, if you guys have told us something.
Are you tomorrow morning to see how you schedule a set up?
Well, for you, have a great year.
Have a great year.
Well, early in the morning, I have an app for the morning.
So, it would more than likely be, but if I might get out,
I can try to make it to you guys by 4 p.m.
Oh, okay.
You're enough.
My tomorrow, she's going somewhere and I'll do.
If I tomorrow was set up the courtesy hold on the car.
Okay.
Yeah, that'd be good because that way you don't have any
missed communications.
And if you can make it abundantly clear to them on their part,
you know, so that I don't waste my time, gas or toll.
No, 100% 100% NIA.
Okay.
So then, I'll follow up with you.
I'll be up in the same changes with the status of the vehicle for today.
Then I'll notify you before we close.
We're going to wait.
And then I'll touch the heels for tomorrow.
Just to see if you're so scheduled to come in at 4 o'clock.
Okay.
What would you be able to put the courtesy hold up on it as of today for tomorrow by 4?
4 tomorrow.
Not by 4 today for tomorrow.
I'll go to that.
So the microphone is changing changes.
Okay.
So anything changes just, you know, you have my number.
You can get it.
I have your number and your email.
Okay.

Okay.
