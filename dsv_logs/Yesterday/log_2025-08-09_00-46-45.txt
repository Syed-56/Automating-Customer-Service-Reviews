Thank you for coming, Madam Chair.
Can I have your comments?
Hi, can I speak to someone in sales?
Okay, we can find new cards.
I just have a question about currently offers for the Prologs and new, is that how you
get Prologs?
Okay, can you for...
If I do more than a...
Yes, correct.
Okay, one more moment that I try to feed her a day of threshold.
For your convenience.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for having me.
Over here.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming.
We settled back for work, home or downtown.
Did you have some more outstanding customers?
Good afternoon, services, Larry.
Hi.
I've seen that there's been quite a few, I guess, advertising and store like a really good
lead software on the Prologs.
Oh, yes.
It's a very popular card.
That's a plug-in card.
So, we can...
It does fully electric, correct?
Yeah, it's fully electric.
So, do you have that really good deal for 159 a month?
I can take a look and see.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
My name's Christina Martin.
Okay.
Do you live here in Walnut Creek?
Five living crop units.
Ah, I'll skip and jump away.
Not my compliance, Liz.
Now, the 159 is that on the...
That's, I believe, on the EX model, if I remember correctly.
I wouldn't know.
Okay.
But I...
I want a really low monthly payment.
I was looking at the Prolog and I thought,
looks interesting.
That's coming in, look at it.
We might know like, the card.
I want to pay as little down as possible and have a low
as possible monthly payment.
Okay.
So, let me see.
That 159 a month.
That's on the baseball, which is the EX.
Okay.
So, we're going to see.
Right now, I have a number of the ones.
I have the top aligned.
The first one is the third.
Oh, I still need to look like on that one.
I believe, find out for you here.
Did you do?
Did you do?
Did you do?
The even those are coming in.
So, yeah, this is boy, a lot more popular.
And I thought, let's see if we do, like, maybe.
Did you?
Oh, and I forgot to ask.
What are you driving right now for seeing this?
Well, I'm keeping my car.
I have a service.
I have a service.
Oh, okay.
Fantastic.
I want you to sub-roll.
This is 2019.
I'm not fading it in.
No, no, that's fine.
The reason why I asked there is that there's a service that
has a lot of money to make sure that you're
that's available to you here.
We have a 2014 vault and we have a 2019 vault.
And we'll probably get rid of this 2014.
We'll probably just sell that.
Okay.
Definitely work for us here.
Yeah, the elite, which is a top-of-line one with the
incentives that they have on it with 3500 down.
The payment, including tax, comes with 385.
79.
So, I mean, of course, it's a nice and
pretty upgrade option, but I don't want to do that much.
For Matt.
So, if I'm looking at the 159, what you call the
basic model, you have some of those available?
I do.
I have one that's actually incoming.
We had a number of them in person, but they, but the
programs that they're running, they call very quickly.
Let's do this.
Here's the hall-wheel-drive version.
And I'm kind of taking on a color like I want.
I'll just boom.
It's kind of nice.
But, yeah, I mean, I want the cards that I want.
Yeah, I have a mercury silver one, which.
Oh, perfect.
Yeah.
Do you think it's incoming?
Yeah, I think I'm.
So, I think I'll go ahead and do this.
Yeah, we can get one.
One, two, three.
Yeah, one, two, three.
I'm sorry, Chris.
Here's just taking me a second.
No worries.
Oh, that's what the problem is.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, actually, a few seconds to set all these together here.
So, if we're this one's an all-wheel-drive version.
That's nice.
And so, with the same 3500 down, we're at $2.9952.
Nine clues, tax, too.
So, that's my actual monthly price.
Yeah, so, a lot of times when they get me careful,
and you probably know that.
I don't wear.
Yeah.
Yeah, because there's tax on that payment on the car.
But there's also tax on the federal rebates.
And that's what makes it kind of tricky.
So, with 3500, this includes all the tax and everything.
You're at $2.9952.
Is that $3,500 off the door or is there additional tax on top of that?
No, no, that was just $3,500 as the drive-off.
So, 3500 down $2.99 a month.
That's it.
We're $2.99 a month, including tax.
Yeah, so, that's it.
3500 down, no additional fees, costs, period, out the door.
And then that's a pretty good, that's interesting.
Okay, so, what, let's talk about the base model, but it's all-wheel-drive.
That's the only route.
So, we'll drive.
So, yeah, if you want to go up into nowhere and incline the conditions,
you all will drive a gift option.
So, that's a good thing.
Yeah, so what other, so what am I?
What is the feature?
I guess I can look online, but.
Yeah, I'd call that safety feature, as you have with it.
That's what I guess is when keeping the services and types for it's on it.
The seats fold down in the back, so you can double a size feature.
You can use hand-rowy.
That always slows Apple CarPlay with it too.
Does it have leather seats?
No, the EX-L have a clock seat.
So, if you want to go leather, you have to go up to the joiners of the elite model.
Yeah.
Okay.
Can you, what, can you tell with this vehicle?
Can you tell?
What, what, what can I tell?
Don't get it, tell.
Like, what is, you know, what's all?
Oh, what could tell?
I don't believe on this vehicle, so I could check and just be sure.
Let me try something here.
What am I going to do with how I said to you, such an on-hold for just a second here?
Okay.
Okay.
We understand you're working to make every dollar go farther, that is why we partnered with some of the best financial teams in the market, to bring you the most flexible plans and packages to suit everybody.
So stop by, and it'll be great on the on-hold details.
We'll be right with you.
Welcome to Walnut Creek Honda.
Can you recently explore the benefits of leasing a car?
There are now more options than ever.
What do you enjoy the newest features of our Honda with less money upfront and the shorter commitment?
We offer low lease payments, flexible plans, and if you discover you want to feature a vehicle at the end of your lease, we offer terrific higher programs.
How much are we about to do today?
Oh, hi, Christina.
Thanks for being so patient.
Actually, I'm, I'm pulled it up on the main computer here in the office.
One of my deals, I'm going to transfer you over to the main office, and my boss will take the phone out, he's checking it right now.
Okay.
Just about a second or so.
Okay, thank you.
How many an experience how Walnut Creek Honda is simply different?
I think it's a Walnut Creek Honda for sure, thank you.
Hi.
I was just transferred to the phone, tell you how it's coming.
Yeah, you were looking, you're interested in a prologue and you were asking about potentially telling with it, correct?
Yeah.
Is there, is there a tenant?
Yeah, let me just check here.
Maybe not looking at it, maybe not.
I don't think so, but I want to confirm.
Okay.
So that's a good question for sure.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay.
15 hundred dollars.
Okay.
It's not worth it.
I don't think that's enough.
I don't think that's enough.
So I would really love to discuss car efforts the lowest monthly price, like the one
of the two I'm still.
Uh huh.
And I was speaking to you, I'm sorry, I can't remember anything.
Was it there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He was telling me about one of the incoming, but it was two ninety nine a month.
Right.
You must be known as just less the taxes and the fees.
And so I told him, yeah, the total payment that's about right.
And then, you know, we have some, we have some good discount from the vehicle and then, of course, they have quite a few incentives.
But yeah, when you have the taxes and the fees and everything that it comes out to about that, would that still make sense for you?
Or, well, I mean, potentially, I really don't want to have to use down payment.
I really would write it a row monthly payment because the start second vehicle only don't need something expensive.
So potentially, yeah, we would just have to come in and take a look.
Okay.
Yeah.
So I can went Larry know to contact you when that vehicle comes in at the moment.
Let me double check here.
But you do have some total odds on the lot that we think about.
I do have some total odds on the lot.
And the particular one that we were discussing, it looks like that'll be coming in right around the end of the month.
So around twenty nine to the second.
But it is something that, you know, if you came in and you drove the prologue and you liked the way it drove, you could certainly, you could certainly reserve that vehicle.
And then when it comes in, you just finished up the paperwork.
Okay.
That sounds good.
Okay.
So I'll share this information with my husband and we'll see if we could find some time to come in.
Sounds great.
My name is Matthew.
I'm one of the sales managers.
If you can't wait to learn a real case.
Thank you for your help.
Please sit it.
Sure.
You're welcome.
Bye bye.
