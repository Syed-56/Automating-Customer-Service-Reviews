Good afternoon, this is Jen.
Hi, Jen. This is Mike and I'm here.
Hi, good afternoon. How are you?
Good. How are you?
Good. So I need to work with Stephen Rayla and I just wanted to touch base with you.
They forward me. You're inquiry about if your credit submission would work at Charlotte
any short answer that is no, but BMW or many would approve you at Charlotte if you submitted your information again.
They give you the same parameters that they would give us.
So that would be all set. As far as the mini getting one here for you is definitely not a problem.
I just kind of wanted them to go over the bill sheets with you and see which one caught your eye.
Rayla had said that the white one wasn't necessarily your favorite.
The panic got sold and so now there isn't even one here for you to drive because that was our last one.
So I understand the kind of restorative and window here.
I guess that I'm sure to make it easier, not harder.
So I just wanted to touch base with you and see what we're doing.
If you want me to push through getting the car here or if you are going to go to Charlotte because that would be really silly.
I brought a car in from Charlotte and you went to Charlotte to see it.
So I'm just trying to see what's up.
Yeah. More on where the Charlotte is.
Okay. All right.
Well, fair enough. It's got a good group up there. I actually moved here from that store about four years ago.
So, you know, I know Brian is in today. He's one of his blind advisors.
Did you call up there and talk to anybody?
Yes. We did.
Okay. We called the finance company. We called BMW.
Yeah. This is the route we're going.
I said today off for this.
I guess.
Yeah. I understand.
Well, good.
Well, like I said, they've got a good team up there.
I heard a few of those guys and Sean, the sales manager.
He was one of my sales guys when I was there.
And he was promoted to sales manager. He's a great guy.
So there was a chain care.
Okay. Cool. All right. Thank you, Jonathan.
Bye-bye.
