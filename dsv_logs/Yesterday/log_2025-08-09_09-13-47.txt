Transcript:
They're called Volkswagen Affairs Guilders and Michael.
There are Michael's uniqueo, especially in Mountage.
Oh, hey buddy, how you doing?
Doing all right, growing it has it going to be.
Doing good, doing good.
I appreciate it. Did you get the... Did you hear pain like this?
I did, yeah. Yeah. I like the black one, especially this little black black look for it.
I hear it.
I moved that transfer back off my car to my...
Sure, sure, sure, in the worst day of your time.
All right, you go ahead and you crank over.
So I'll just... I'll just put a handle on what I can...
Sure, this way.
You just keep it up.
I'd actually be able to show up at the phone for today.
I can't have to go show up for their appointment.
But with that being said, it's super clean and the price of it is insane.
So the other thing is...
It's really good opportunity, right?
That and the car might qualify for the even tax rebate up to 4K.
So if you didn't already claim that on your Nissan lease and it's qualified and you...
Go ahead, start.
Yeah, no, I did not get the... the cash fitted back for the lease.
All I got was the P.G. Union, my utility company in the area.
I gave a clean energy rebate, which was separate from the EV tax credit.
But Nissan part of the Sago with this car, they took too long to file the paperwork on the e-mail.
They gave us the e-mail tax credit.
So I just... I gotta do my taxes.
I can't be waiting on you.
Yeah, all right, so it's not terrible.
Well, what that being said is the car qualifies and obviously it's not what he might qualify as well, right?
You're gonna apply that to the car to the down payment.
You know where the taxes filing or waiting on us later on, right?
We'll just apply it as a down payment.
Okay, and now we'll come off the car.
So if... I don't want to talk about negative equity or anything with your cardiac,
I still got a little of Josh offered and all that stuff.
But what that being said is the car's $17 in the car qualifies for $14,000.
That's $13,000 Tesla, right?
So that's super-
That's a killer deal at that point.
Yeah, because I'm trying to keep my monthly payments around or under this 300 a month part.
So the car's only, you know, 13 grand.
We're talking about, is there about...
I'll be much easier to do.
Correct.
And then depending on your credit flows well, if I can find a strong bank with a great rate,
you definitely get to where you want to do.
Yeah, we'll see if this will make a work.
Well, here's the first step, right?
I heard that Jeff, that you might want to start out as a mo deal, right?
Which is fine.
I definitely want you to test out the car.
But if you want to get free qualified and find out if you qualify in the car qualify for the EV tax credit,
we can always do that, right?
And you'll have all the concrete numbers with your training.
And just to clarify for EV and you qualify everything good, you actually see the final number.
And you can just make that decision.
You know, obviously at that point, like, yeah, I will be there.
Then we can just steal it up.
Alright, sounds great.
Yeah, because I'm just running numbers right now.
There's most likely going to be negative equity with the lease.
I kind of know, I've got no illusions about how much you get resoled for, you know?
I understand the idea.
Even though this is a newer one, I have an upgraded battery on it too.
So it doesn't just run on the ocean range, quite barely.
Yeah, it's a little so good to know, right?
Yeah, I actually have another question for you.
It's not a bad thing because they're good to have, especially when things hit the thing, right?
But the key protection as far as like a vehicle service protection plan,
is you get the beginning of those things with that need, Tommy.
Yeah, I had them originally and then I ended up in our canceling them because much money back before going through this whole process.
You know, smart about the story.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Because it went right.
Oh, it got a lot.
Yeah, exactly.
So it got a big paydown recently.
And now it's closer to, because obviously I understand at the end of the day,
the shelves are going to give me the best trade in value, right?
They want to get their car back.
Yeah.
So there's really ones that there was no way negative equity for,
but with them, because they had a marble tree around this price point to show me.
But when I went in test right, they couldn't find the car on the lot.
I was there all day, they couldn't find the car at any other lot, sitting at a first-lapse,
or anything.
So I was like, well, can't get a car.
I'm going to drive, guys, so you can't find.
Got it.
So I'm either, I guess, maybe waiting for them to find it,
or seeing what you look like and get at other places, right?
Because I'm sure we'll start working on these phone as a whole from the whole experience that I've had with.
Like currently, because when I got it, it had a existing battery trouble that they hadn't noticed.
Or just felt like not telling me at the time.
So I was without the car for two months after buying it.
It was involved in the battery.
It was the same place.
Hopefully I took out a can.
It was, yeah, the battery replacement was free,
because they were like, hey, we should have seen this.
Oh, no, we're not waiting.
Oh, no.
I didn't get another one.
I thought it happened unfortunately.
Yeah, that's terrible.
Like when you buy a brand new, you buy a brand new,
or I'm assuming they're releasing it, right?
So no, I have a room for it.
I bought a new, I bought a new, I bought a new, I bought a new,
I bought a new, I bought a new, yeah, yeah.
Got it.
So you're financing it.
I'm financing it, yes.
Perfect.
All right, yeah, because my next question was, I got a very fine list of a benefit that we can even buy.
You are your least, right?
Because we're both like, that's it.
It's fine, yes, it doesn't make a difference.
All right, cool.
So let's do this.
I will open tomorrow at 9am.
Okay.
And I just sit down with your house.
I don't know what your availability is for tomorrow,
but I want them to bar you with phone call,
let me choose your text.
That's for you, I guess.
Because tomorrow I'm actually going in, I'm going with some friends
who are going to check out their own,
some used Model S's over here in Sacramento.
So since I have been looking at Tesla for the last like month or so,
I wanted to take me along because I think
I've got a pretty good idea of what to look out for.
What's the love of the usual ones at this point?
Yeah, do you know what?
If it doesn't work out in stack, please come see us with the Model S
because I have a plaid and then I have just a regular Model S
and a both black.
So, well, is this one of the biggest,
the prior you're going to go for this one because it's over here.
If it's 2014 Model S or 8K or something,
it's an obvious thing in deal for just this second car to have.
Make sure about that.
Well, yeah.
You know, here's a thing though.
I must have carved it upgraded.
This is one thing that you might want to down to my range.
This is problem.
I told an older Model S, I think it was a 2014.
So, well, I figured it was one of the first gen, right?
And they purchased it and went out to Tesla
just out on our whole lot of bottom.
But apparently, there's no supercharger.
So, what I mean is, if you're a Tesla supercharger,
it's still going to take that car like eight hours with charge.
So, you just need a, what's it called?
It's just a software update you can do
that lets you use the adapters for the new chargers.
Current.
What's that?
What's that around?
Isn't that how they like, kind of, ran or something?
No.
No, it's a free thing you can have done for them.
It's probably enabled that would take the adapter,
which as far as I know.
Yeah, I would definitely look into that.
Because I ran into a hole with the problems with the,
which was that.
I mean, we took, we took care of it, but yeah, it was a nightmare
because if I had a customer drug for about $6 an hour
and I had like 40% or something like, oh my God.
And the batteries, and there's nothing wrong
because we had the battery truck.
It's just like, uh-huh.
When we brought it to the layout of Tesla, they're like, yeah,
heat up grade, what you send the software and stuff like that.
And they send like a bill and it was a lot.
It was a lot.
I'm not sure what they could make.
Because you might think, I think of this like 10 grand is,
you know, if you have to replace the motor or the drive train,
I know it can be that expensive.
The thing that's out for us, you know,
I'm creating the whole computer system is 1200.
It's perfect.
I take tough grades also, the new,
the newest practice here in the new machines on it.
I don't know.
So if we had that, I don't know, maybe we should try to get more
money out of it or seeing it.
Probably, no one was up.
Sure.
I'll just kind of look, sounds like, right.
I'm glad you're gonna know, you're stuck, so that's good.
Probably teach them, I'll teach them, teach them,
and thank you.
Oh, I'll help you do this.
At 9A, 9A in tomorrow, I'll get with Josh.
I'll get the information on your trade.
And I'll teach you a set.
If you say, might find out if I qualify in a car qualify,
or the EV tax credit, I will have to,
because I don't do anything.
I don't do anything through tech when it comes to, you know,
social security stuff like that, but the problem is,
so we do things over here a little bit differently and more
of a compliance.
So it's considered a new right way.
So basically, my finance manager will take your social security
and we'll go on the IRF website just to make sure.
I know you, I'm not saying that you're like,
you're lying to me that you got to claim that we need to be super
bare.
You need to think of super bare right, because we don't want to
get it later, later on with it.
So I would just basically have a quick conversation with you
over the phone and it's recorded.
And I'll just give that social directly to finance and I'll run you
and go run the car.
If everything's good on that, I will put the EV tax credit
and I'll send you over a quote of what it could look like.
Okay.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Because I love the no two because I just need to get that for granted.
So that's what I was going to say.
It would be like, yeah, I'm sure I may say,
I should have gotten this at some point or something that was
filled out.
Well, you know,
I'm not forgetting about going through all.
So I get five minutes to see run it and it says that you've got
already and they never gave a few.
Now you got, you know, some likes of three times,
but it's like, you're exactly.
You're staying on a clear couch and I found it.
Yeah.
I could get it.
Then retroactively, I'll just output that towards, you know,
paying down the leaf so there's no negative equity on it.
Exactly.
Makes sense.
You're more.
I made it a big,
so different to applying it to this stuff like it is the same.
Essentially the same thing, it's been made.
I mean, you're going to pay your car.
Yeah.
If that's going to get applied to your, your loans and pay that down,
none of them put it for the car because we're going to,
it's just, it's eventually the same thing, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're not exactly anymore.
Do you even have to get up?
Yeah.
I don't, I don't suppose anywhere I can send in the,
the trading offers are already gone.
Just from like our local dealerships,
if you guys can match them at all to the case where you either
love or you know,
you're going to be the best officer for your car.
And we'll match it.
It's going to be the car.
You want to know why?
The car, man.
Why is that?
I don't know.
You know,
you know,
we're going to give you the best officer for your car.
And we'll match it.
It's going to be car.
You want to know why?
The car, man.
Why is that?
The nation,
they have a nation-wide graph.
Unlike these local dealerships that only have a certain mile radius.
So they go by current market value of like a 500 to a thousand mile radius
and then car max as a nation-wide reach.
I mean,
I haven't just sent those offers.
But then those offers over to me and I'll take a look
and see if we can match those.
But I mean, it's car max.
Okay.
And they're like,
we'll take your car and here's no negative equity.
And it's like,
what is the data?
A lot of legal.
And not the online one.
And we'll just know it's the right next door.
That car max.
And we'll just follow the guess.
There you go.
Okay.
To go all options.
Uh huh.
Yeah.
I haven't even checked car max.
Yeah.
It's just because
I don't know.
They have a brand new model for you.
It's not in my pressure.
It's the first name part of that must be listened.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I mean,
I think you'll just want it super clean.
It looks like it's a new version because of the tail light.
And obviously,
Yeah.
Well, I like to better.
What is the most very first one that has the new battery technology.
The LSP battery instead of the NMC ones.
So they can charge 200% and it doesn't degrade it.
Uh huh.
And that'd be just one less thing to worry about.
You know?
Correct.
And then you can actually just completely charge your car
every time you're charged.
That's how you do it.
You're right.
You're right.
Every day.
Yeah.
So every day with a full-time gig.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, they said, all right.
Well, hey,
Diego, it was a pleasure speaking with you.
So I will text you as soon as I get more information.
Please send those offers over to me.
You got a good note.
And then if you're able to get out to a car max and get that,
let me know.
Then I'd over.
And then, um, yeah.
I mean,
if you want to find out about the EV tax credit,
it's a shooting attack from a good time for phone callers.
So I can give it to the finance manager.
Okay.
All right.
That'd be perfect.
All right.
I will talk to you tomorrow, man.
You have a great one.
You too.
Thank you.
All right.
Take care.
Bye.
Result: [2] Yes, at a loose time or range of time exceeding 1 hour
