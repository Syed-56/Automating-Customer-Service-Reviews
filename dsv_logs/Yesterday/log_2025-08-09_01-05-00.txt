Yes, is Cody there please.
Cody, what was actually off?
Oh, okay.
I will talk about it.
No, I'm calling in about a few now.
I guess it could be one in the same.
Maybe you can help me real quick.
There is a Ford Explorer in the face, face silver color.
Okay.
Almost on the lot.
Do you know where that is?
Do you know where that is on the lot?
Is that in the new car a lot or the new car lot?
Most likely as Cody was right here.
It would have been a new car.
Yeah, I was a thought show.
I don't see that.
I was out here right now actually.
And I don't see anything that looks like a space silver color.
I was just wondering where I might put my eyes on that particular color.
You see it's still out there now.
Face silver was the color.
No space silver.
A pink OPA 30 is what you put in these email.
There is a space white.
You got plenty of those.
So this is space.
I'm just looking at the inventory online here.
I don't see it.
I didn't see it in the inventory online.
Yeah, if it's not showing on that inventory online, maybe he is talking about a use car
potentially, but we did just sell space white.
The color.
I never heard of space silver.
I never heard of space silver either until he sent me an email.
Earlier in the week.
I'd be a brand new color.
Let's that up real quick.
Maybe I just haven't seen one yet.
Yeah, I, I emailed him back and said, hey, do you actually have any of that color?
Because that was a new car to me.
And I wanted to put my eyes on it.
And he said, we've got one on the lot.
And I said, well, I'm going by here today.
I started swinging real quick and put my eyes on it.
But don't look like that's going to happen.
Oh, you know what they do have that space silver and the expectations, I think.
Maybe that's right.
Maybe he can use the two because we do have a gentleman who's driving a space.
Silver expedition.
Is it out?
You mean a demo car?
It would be one of our managers.
And he just recently went on vacation.
So he's in.
He's not.
He's not here with that vehicle.
Yeah, maybe that was.
Yeah, maybe that's.
But Toby's off today.
My apologies.
If you pull back in on Monday, maybe he could allude as to what it was.
I don't know.
Okay.
There's one to be out there.
My apologies on that.
What was your name?
Frank.
He'll know who I am.
Okay.
Well, good.
All you use explores wherever they're on the north side of the.
The showroom, right?
I mean, yeah.
Okay.
I didn't.
Walk through there.
Okay.
We're here.
Listen.
Thank you to help.
Yes, appreciate it.
Have your one.
Uh.
