These are diesel vehicles, so whether you're buying them.
I'm going to go to the market.
I'm going to go to the market.
I'm going to go to the market.
I'm waiting for a 45 bypass engine.
I'm going to go to the market.
Well, it's very hard.
You can go to the market.
Yes, right, so it's good to have a truck.
I'm going to go to the market.
I don't know.
If you can do it, lollipop, you can do that.
If you want to do this, I'm going to do it.
So, he's going to have a few more items.
Thank you so much for calling Victory Honda of Jacks and have my director call.
I need to speak to somebody and say, oh please.
Sure, hang on just a second. I'm getting ready to go.

Shopping for a vehicle should be fun.
We're Victory Honda of Jackson.
Hello, this is working.
Hi, are you in sales?
Yes ma'am.
Hi, I was calling to say if you also had the 2022 Toyota 4Runner, the red one.
We have it.
Right now there's a couple things going on with it.
It does have an airbag sensor.
We do our safety inspection and stuff like that.
Any type of center or anything that falls under the safety and the durability, anything needs to be fixed.
We fix it.
It's actually got another lot right now getting fixed today.
You get that going on.
Then we actually have the reason this price to wait is as you see in the pictures,
I'm not used to put the pictures on the West Side.
So you see how the third row is down.
It does have third row.
The third row, get the third row and the back.
It's kind of small.
There's really not a 4Runner.
There's really not that much room in the third row.
A lot of people just lay that down.
They're not doing whatever they got.
The third dog had went, I don't know.
I don't know if they gave it some sugar or what, but it bit the seat and toward the seat in the back.
My understanding, the upholstery guy, one of his largest in the home in the leg,
takes it.
General Manager didn't want to fix it.
He's going to sell it.
When it came to that back, he saved you out of the mechanically wild.
It's all getting fixed.
That's the reason you see the seat has laid down.
That's the reason it's priced the way it is.
I could have realized that the third row.
I don't have any children.
This is me and my husband.
Like I said, I can get it here.
You live here in Jackson?
I live in November.
Is there a time that you can get it here by tomorrow?
I have to lunch.
Is that something that you guys want to drive down here?
Because I can call over there and verify what is.
I get your first name.
Is it Melinda Cornell?
Is that right?
It's not.
Somehow the phone comes up next to me.
That's my mother's name.
I am Nicky Gregory.
Mackenzie?
Yes, and I have talked to the people at victory of Diresburg about before I know.
Yes.
But, yeah, it's our car.
They're just fixing it for us.
It's a victory location.
It's not a car.
It's a dair's ferry.
We're trying to fix it.
But the car is coming back to our lot.
It's allocated to our dealership.
We just got it up there to get it fixed.
Okay.
Well, Diresburg was actually based on this easy.
I made the test rapid.
And I'll tell you, we're in the process of selling my Jeep.
Somebody might have been off-romed.
I couldn't refuse.
Yeah.
But we're wanting to hit the title back before it will give us the check.
So, but I am all for it right now.
I took off a few days.
And I was really, if y'all feel high, that my stepdad had driven through their twice.
Plus the line in Jackson.
Yeah, it's supposed to be.
You're back for me.
It's supposed to be bringing it back to us today.
I actually talked to the service manager.
But I can call up there and see what's going on.
And then I can give you a call back.
I've got you.
You've succeeded, correct?
Yeah.
But if I could test drivers at Diresburg and say,
I'm going to sprint all the way to Jackson.
And if I like it, I will come to Jackson to do the paperwork.
Yeah, I can find it.
I don't know how they would do that.
Because, again, it's allocated to us.
Let me just sign.
Let me find out what's going on with the AirBacks Center.
Just to see if it's cat down.
Because I feel it's supposed to get down.
And I talked personally to the sales or the service manager yesterday,
because I had a gentleman that was in Kentucky that was wanting a car.
That's reason it was coming back here.
Because he was trying to schedule a time to look at it as well.
But if you've been to the bunch, come here and be to the bunch.
First come, first serve.
But let me call up there and find out what's going on with it.
And then I'll give you a call back.
All right.
Thank you.
All right.
All right.
