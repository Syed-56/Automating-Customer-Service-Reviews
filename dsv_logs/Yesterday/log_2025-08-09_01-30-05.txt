Jason.
Hey, Jason Logan.
Hey, buddy, what's going on?
Oh, not much.
Our next week called now.
I'm at work right now.
It's part of the reason you couldn't hear me earlier.
Yeah.
So, you know, I'm interested for serving that Subaru.
Especially if you guys will pay cash.
But kind of where I'm sitting at man is, you know, after I left there the other day,
I just kept looking at cars and I found them near the same vehicle.
It's, you know, 2013 Subaru 2.5i or whatever.
Down in Harrisonville at a little mom and pop a lot.
For.
I talked about down to 87 50 cash and he was willing to throw in a 12 month, 12,000 mile
warranty if I was willing to pay him 900 and test.
Yeah.
And I said, well, you know, let me, let me think about that.
You know, because that's, that's my big, that's my big deal.
It is buying a used car.
I want to make sure it's reliable or that I can get it more and T can fix if it's,
if it's not reliable.
You know what I mean?
Right.
If I remember correctly, looking at that Subaru at y'all's a lot, the, the backup camera
wouldn't come on.
We put it in reverse.
Mm hmm.
Um,
So there was a little bit of squirrel damage in the motor.
There was some interior damage.
You've been smoked in a little bit of paint scratching on the driver's side.
Mm hmm.
I just wonder, you know, like what shape the drive train would be on, on that vehicle?
Well, ours is not going to be a 12 month, 12,000 miles.
We, we provided three month, 3,000 miles that comes with it.
Okay.
Okay.
If you wanted more of a warranty, you can definitely get more.
You just have to pay for it as long.
Yeah.
And then zero percent interest plans.
And I know you don't like to make payments, but if something you can consider.
Yeah.
Um,
What do y'all think?
Oh, I see.
Well, I've got a $9,500 clear to where I can sell it for $9,500 out the door.
That also provided you with a 3 month, 3,000 mile power train warranty.
So power train, I'm pretty sure you know, but just to kind of give you a heads up.
Anything that touches the oil, it would be covered.
That also provides you with a rental car, in case you need something like that.
Uh, Tony wrote that assistance.
So it's pretty, it's pretty, pretty good.
Power train warranty.
Yeah.
No, I agree.
Um,
I think these folks on the Harrisonville man, um, their warranty is, it's just bumper to bumper and,
and there is, it's, uh, more expensive warranty than what comes because they have to, you know,
you want 3,000 on all their cars.
Uh,
like I say with it being a used car, the, the reliability is my concern on it.
And you know, they're, they're willing to work for me on that man.
That's important to me.
Right.
I mean, I've got a couple hundred dollars.
I don't have, I don't have a thousand dollars or anything like that.
Uh, but if, uh, I just wanted to be out from it to talk straight with you and let you know, hey, I'm there.
I'm, uh, my jobs that earn your, earn your businesses, uh, my customers.
So if it's something you want to consider, I'd love to sell it to you.
All right.
Um, let me think about it some one day.
You know, already came and drove it.
I like the way it drives.
Um, I like it's all good to check out, you know, the electrical figure out if it's a fuse or something with that backup camera.
Um,
I, I, I like having that backup camera man.
And I like to be able to, I don't know if it's the old, uh, you know, the whole head, the screen doesn't work.
What if it's, you know, I don't know what that issue might be.
That's, that's right.
I would, you know, like to be addressed if I bought that car.
Okay.
I could work on that.
Awesome.
Yeah.
I mean, other than that man, that, that'd be my only real concern.
Um, I can probably work with, you know,
working around aftermarket warranty or something like that.
Yes.
And, and my finance team and they can kind of go over that stuff with you as well.
Uh, I'm not kind of saying something else is warranty.
It's not as good as ours, but we're a big company.
So our warranty is going to be covered.
Any ASE certified shop.
So any Subaru shop that, that's close to you.
We would always recommend you take it there because they're the experts that work on it and you're covered anywhere.
Yeah.
Um, if you do a mommy, that color is like 165,000 on it or 170,000 or something like that.
Let me look real quick.
So I just know that the 200,000 mile service is like two grand.
Uh, it's got 141.
141.
Yeah.
All right.
Cool.
Um, that's kind of 141.
Yeah.
All right.
Cool.
Um, yeah.
Like I say, I'm interested in it, man.
Uh, let me think about it.
Let me talk.
Um, just talk from all day about, you know, we lived together.
So I don't want to.
Yes, sir.
I'm not jumping anything without her.
I don't want that.
I don't want that.
A big way to ask me.
Yes, sir.
I'm not.
Uh, so.
Yes, you're smart about it.
Yeah, I tried to be.
So let me, let me talk with her this weekend and talk things over.
Um, and then, you know, if we got it on my phone,
I'll give you a call back and talk about it more on Monday.
Absolutely.
Let me ask you that.
Can you do me a favor?
Yeah.
Can you talk to her tonight?
Let me know.
Possibly Saturday morning.
Say, hey, you know what?
I want to come and buy it.
I can't get there till Monday.
What I can do is I can take it to deposit on it.
So somebody comes in and Saturday trying to buy it.
I could say it's sold.
Yeah.
Um, I might be working more and more.
Morning.
I'm not sure yet.
Um, I'm, I work.
I was here to spend one at a countertop shop here in Kansas City.
Um, what we call.
I'm sorry.
I work for a company called Finkel Surfaces.
Okay.
Um, we're.
We did one of the biggest stops in the city, but we got a bunch of work coming through right now.
All of the sudden I should.
I don't know.
Um, what are schedules looking like for the rest of the day or we already got a text for the manager saying,
hey, you don't want to come in the marrow.
You're shit done today.
So I don't know where we're all sitting.
I know where I'm sitting on that.
I don't know where everybody else is sitting on that.
So right.
What is it that you do?
I'm a machinist man.
I just run.
Um, I, I spent in front of the machine out.
I moved a little bit going down here and there.
But I stand in front of the machine and run it.
Run simple programs and stuff.
Mm hmm.
Okay.
Sorry.
So.
Yeah.
Uh, like I say, um, if I'm not working, you know, in the morning, uh, I'll talk over with her, you know, and, uh,
if I can't get in, you know, get into deposit now, how much would you want for the deposit, man?
Uh, just $500.
I'll shit.
Okay.
Yeah.
You can put it on credit card or debit card or whatever you want to do.
Yeah.
I could do that in a problem.
Uh, perfect.
So yeah.
Let me talk with her.
Let me, uh, just talk about it real quick.
Think about it.
And I'll get back to you soon if I can't.
Absolutely.
I appreciate it.
And thanks for taking my call and I appreciate you calling me back.
Yep.
Yes, sir.
Bye bye.
