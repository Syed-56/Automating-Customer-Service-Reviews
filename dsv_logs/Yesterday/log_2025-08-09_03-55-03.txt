I'm trying.
Yeah.
Hello.
Hey, Amy.
Thank you.
Back in the case, somebody's getting me a text message and I, you get disturbed by this, this
sound of it.
Okay.
It's stopped now.
Yeah.
You know what?
Don't, don't give up on me yet because I'm really, I'm wanting to do something.
I just don't quite make up my mind which way to go yet.
You know what I'm saying?
You're fine.
That's okay.
Yeah.
So yeah.
The offers you were making me are very, uh, camping for the sat way.
What did you do?
What did you do?
Uh, I, I haven't told you anything yet.
I did.
Yeah.
I had to go back after the painted pack vision and get in there to Albert saying you
can get in on the good deals and stuff.
Then I came home so then we'll go back up to Albert soon again and then all our ideas.
So I can binge you today.
Yes.
All right.
You started.
Yeah.
Hope.
Yeah.
It's all your fault.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, well.
I kept your apology.
I kept asking.
Yeah.
Okay.
Brian.
Yeah.
Let's go.
I'm going.
Now wait a minute.
I was kind of on the ground because I didn't write my transformation down and if I don't
write it, you know, it goes over my head.
You did my memory.
So that's that.
What was that offer on the drill blade where I forgot?
Well, five.
12 five.
Okay.
All right.
And I don't think I could swing the truck because I would work.
I have that truck.
But that's that's that's that's true.
All my money.
That's what I got in my savings thing.
So I need to be a little careful.
You know, I need to be a hot water careful because I'm not planning on growing,
going broke over something, you know what I'm saying.
So but yeah, I'm I'm.
It's I'm thinking about it.
I know I'm not just brushing it off or anything.
But I think something might happen.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, should I expect you tomorrow?
Oh no, no, give me that no, give me the weekend because I've got a point to
point to date, you know, that we're busy for the next couple of days. So I'll say what, I can come back in there.
Monday, it might be early afternoon, but I got to get with wind and tell him, you know, what the offers are.
And so we'll see. I know what you'll want to do. And I don't want to do it is the teacher said good by dinner,
but I can't stand doing. When we got to Camaro, I mean the camera from Harold, that was hours and hours.
It's sit around, it's sit, sit, sit, and it takes so long. And I get to get wore out like that, you know.
And then if you don't find something at one lock, then you have to go to another lock and another lock and you're so freaking tired.
And I just, I don't want to do it now. I'm too old for it. And I don't care like I used to.
I do so. Anyway, yeah, so Brian, yeah, it's not a done deal yet. So I hope he gets something to work out.
All right. Okay.
Good. We have a good week.
I know.
You too. My who's coming to my day. We'll go back. We'll go back.
But yeah, I put a plan on you. Okay.
So that's about to get together with my son and dad.
I he should just go with me. So you'll see what, you know, so he can see too, you know,
so anyway, all right, Brian, I hope he's built better than he has been.
So anyway, okay. Well anyway, you have a good week, you know, okay.

some time or something. Other than that, just expecting somewhere,
probably somewhere in the neighborhood around that.
