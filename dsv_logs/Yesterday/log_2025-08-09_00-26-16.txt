Thank you for calling Michael's Toyota of Bellevue. Please hold while we connect you to the next available team member.
This call is being recorded.
Thanks for holding this phone. Can you tell me if Anne is there today, Anne?
Anne is here. Anne is here. Let me try to feed to her.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We wish you a warm walk.
Yes.
Hello. Hello. This is Anne's Viggy.
Hi. This is Anne. You should tell me.
Oh, hi. Hi. How are you?
I'm good. How are you?
Well, a fine. So, my husband is looking to get a new Toyota Tacoma truck.
Okay.
So, but he wants a white sport.
White sport, right? Okay.
You are Susan Yoshitomi.
Yeah. Kelly's mother.
Oh, I'm the birthday.
It's Kelly. How is Kelly doing?
He's doing fine. He still has his foot.
And he has a family.
Yes. Exactly. Okay.
Okay. All right. Yes. Okay.
Just in case I get a cut off, what is a good phone number for you, Susan?
Perfect. And then he looking for the Tacoma CID sport.
Yes.
Short that in white.
Long that white color. Okay.
And do you want a short bed or long bed?
No.
But just the right side.
Not the extra.
Make a left side.
Yeah.
And then do you want an extra like the premium package in there that has like a
leather seat or you okay with the cloth seat?
No, we want leather.
Leather, right?
Okay.
So, do you, do you mind to have like a big huge 14-inch screen in there?
Oh, he's perfect care. I don't think he cares.
He doesn't care. But it has to be leather.
Because I probably can do an option of just a regular PID sport for him.
And then you can change the aftermarket leather that probably saves you some money on that.
Because if you go up to the, you go up to the premium one, you're going to get more stuff
in there that sometimes you don't need it.
Oh. Okay.
So, you mean you get it with just cloth seating?
He can get with the cloth and then if you want a leather, you can, we do like an aftermarket
leather change over here.
It's going to be the $2,000 but change all the seats like front and back.
Oh, I think cloth is okay then.
Property is okay.
All right.
Okay.
As long as well.
Black interior.
That interior.
That interior, right?
I got you.
All right.
Okay.
Give me one more minute and then I'll, can I give you a call back at the number you gave me?
Oh, yeah.
There's no hurry because I have a hair appointment this afternoon.
Okay.
That's what time you get done with your hair.
After three o'clock.
After three.
Okay.
Let me check it out.
I have a apartment coming in.
Let me check it out for you and then I'll, I'll call you.
Yeah.
There's no hurry at and just, you know, that's what that's what he's looking for.
So I just wanted to keep what you had.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I'm probably happy to have something that has to be a TRD sport in white.
Correct.
With white color only.
White color only.
Yes, right.
Okay.
Okay.
As you said, is Kelly mad at me?
No.
What?
Um, I'm trying to text him or sometimes send him a message.
I never heard back from him.
Oh, I thought that he might be upset with me.
No, no, no.
He doesn't always answer his text.
You know, he doesn't look at his email either.
I always have to get on him about that.
You know, when I text him, he just respond to me.
I, because he usually respond to my text and then he said,
maybe into math.
If he mad at me, you know, like, and it's just like,
what did I do wrong with Kelly?
Well, I'll tell him that you texted him.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Please help me.
I'm gonna need to read my anything.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
I'm just worried.
Okay.
But I don't get back to you, okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
Bye.
Bye bye.
Have a good day.
Enjoy your hair.
