Thank you for calling, Team Trevor Lee Las Vegas.
Tom, speaking, how many is this?
Yeah, I've been looking at some different pre-qualifications for financing.
Do you guys sign up to Wells Fargo at all?
You've heard of the network?
Yes, I believe so.
90% sure we do with them.
Are you at the only financing that you want to go with?
Well, they've got really good race right now.
So I did the pre-qualifying online with City Bank or Capital One.
And it was pretty high at 6.6.
And I can get better through my credit union or Wells Fargo.
Perfect.
Okay.
How that worked.
We could do the financing here for you if you'd like.
It's pretty easy.
One would you be able to come in?
Well, not anytime soon.
I'm sitting in my recliner shopping online.
So yeah, I'm really impressed with the traverse inventory.
That's kind of what I was looking at.
Gotcha, okay.
Just, you know, they're only coupled.
It's popped up.
So I like that I'm sure the only installment.
Because you have 44 on the line.
Oh, you do.
Okay.
I'm not too picky about the trim level.
I just want the basics.
You know, like the rear hatch and all that kind of stuff power.
I would prefer not black on black.
I don't like black interiors.
It seems like everything that pops up is different.
I can hear you.
Yeah, I don't know why, but that seems to be it.
Yeah, I feel it.
It's awesome.
Yeah, but you know, just picky little things like that.
I've had one for the last, well, I got it's 2015 right now.
So that's how it's been driving for the last 10 years.
So.
And have you seen that in person?
No, I'm comfortable with 2026.
No, no, I haven't even.
I just started shopping.
Okay.
I think my father on a last leg.
Gotcha.
I think it'd be a good idea for you.
At least check them out and see, you know, if you like the size, you know, it's completely remodeled.
So it's got a new look, new interior, new technology.
Is that the same?
It's probably a little bit bigger.
Okay.
They all have a 2.5.
Herbo.
I believe the high countries and the RSS are different.
Give me one second here.
Okay.
So you are there going to be the 2.5 turbo with a 315 horsepower.
All of them.
Yep.
All of them.
Okay.
Cause I do a lot of highway driving to get to work back and I don't want anything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So plenty of power.
Plenty of power, but good on gas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hmm.
One would you like to come in and check it out.
Well, how late are you guys open?
We're here.
I'm here until that's a long day.
Not really.
Sorry.
Do you want to come in and check it out today?
I'm thinking about it.
Yeah.
What's your name again?
My name is Tom Harvey.
Can I get yours?
So I can put it down on my notes.
Where?
My name is Sir.
My name is Suzanne SUSV-A-N-N-E.
Last name is Stittler.
Last name one more time.
Stittler.
S-P-I-T-L-E-R.
Gotcha.
And this is a good number for you.
So that way I can put you down here whenever you're ready to come in.
Yeah.
Hold on a minute.
You say it out.
I want to check a voice, may I?
I don't see.
Where are you?
You there?
Yeah, I'm here.
Okay.
Yeah, set that.
Perfect.
Do you have a, maybe a timeframe of when you think you'd be able to come in?
Oh, maybe at least an hour.
At least an hour.
Oh, one more time.
I'm sorry.
At least an hour.
At least an hour.
Okay.
Sounds good.
Well, I'll be, I'll contact you and then send you over my information.
So when you have a, a direct time that you'd like to come in, I'd be more than happy to assist you.
Okay.
Okay.
As long as there's no pressure because I have just like I said, I'm arm tripping right now.
So no worries.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Have a good night.
Bye.
All right.
