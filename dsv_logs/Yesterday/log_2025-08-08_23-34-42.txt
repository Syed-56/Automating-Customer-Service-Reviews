You got to lower you.
You got to lower you.
You got to lower you.
You're trying to lower you.
You're trying to lower you.
Only hours of work.
Oh, my God.
My 40-4,000.
I hope you're ready to put it.
I hope you're ready to put it.
You're done speaking of cold days.
She actually worked off site and we just were moving.
You see who else has been trying to get in touch with you.
Okay.
Yes.
Alrighty, is this Thomas?
Yes it is.
Hey, this is Emma with Friday Anderson Home of Oz.
You were, I think we were the one that was looking to buy an Odyssey instead of trade
line.
Yeah, and I told you that and I told you I was in the barber chair?
Yes.
Okay.
Well, I'm out of the chair.
So anyway, anyway.
Okay.
So here's the deal.
Well, I looked at this site and I talked to a guy on the site and whatever.
And went from your office to whatever.
And it just so happened there.
Now the actual, quite as looking for, was an Odyssey or a game.
Or a Dodge, it's many bands basically.
Okay.
Where the seats were, where the little image was a few, where the seats fold down into the floor.
Me, me, what happens is with that, that's okay, but what happens with that, it's that's
able to put merchandise inside the vehicle.
Okay.
So you're looking to like store stuff in there.
Yes, because I want the business that I do, I have about talent.
If you know what talent is on.
Is it the bird?
I about to have about talent.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
When I say about talent is all like, max did, all things that Walmart has, things that I did on
talent.
And so there'd be a lot of merchandise, brand new merchandise that I need to go pick it up.
Okay, it's a much storage.
And then put it online.
So you got what I'm saying?
Yes.
Okay.
So anyway, point dealing, I need just a, a, a, a, a, a mini band type of vehicle is what I need.
Mm hmm.
So, I mean.
What's your price range?
What are you hoping to stand or?
Well, I'm going to say like a stand now.
Because I'm looking at the site is because I found that, okay, I think, yeah.
Something for five, uh, you know, something for six.
Okay, thousand.
Okay.
My thing was, okay, I don't have all of this, but also most of those things.
I'm going to bring in whatever, whatever.
But I needed I needed the actual band.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, so I think
so the problem with the older ones, the ones that are going to be
have in 6,000, those are going to be actually harder to get
financed just because with the high mileage,
they get a little nervous with high mileage and
with sending over 10-year gold, they get worried about
financing those vehicles, but we do have a couple other options
that are going to be newer, but still within a good price
and lower mileage, but I think it could be a good fit for you.
Are you using the green-zel area?
Would you just be able to cut by it so we can have you
checking out and make sure they're going to fit your inventory
of the new puttin' in there and run the numbers for you?
Okay, I think right now, I am on the way here.
Right across from Walmart, which is at my barbershop.
Okay.
I don't have, I don't have vehicle right now.
And I don't know if they would be, what your company would be
saying, hey, let's go pick this guy or whatever, whatever,
whatever, whatever.
My thing is basically that's where I'm at right now.
Okay.
Okay.
And you can-
I believe you've spoken Mari beforehand.
So I did it.
I wouldn't.
I would love to get to you.
I would love to get to you.
I mean, I would love to come to you.
But as I said, I don't have a level vehicle.
Now, the vehicle goes down.
Got rid of the vehicle.
And now, so I don't have a vehicle.
So I saw what that-
I'm sorry.
Okay.
You're best.
Let me check with Mari to see if he would be able to run over there
and pick you up.
And just bring you by just so you can check out some
different bands.
Make sure we're going to find something that's going to work for you.
And then we can share you what the numbers are going to look like for you
to do that payment plan.
So that would be great.
So that would be great.
So that would be great.
And then I can share how him give you a call back or I can.
Okay.
I'll be waiting.
I'm ready.
Okay.
Okay.

Thank you.
