Transcript:
So this Daniel, this is Greg. I spoke to you yesterday about the knowledge of AT4s.
You know, Greg, it's funny, you called me because you're literally the next name in my book for me to text.
Oh, really? I'll be happy to do it.
He did.
Yeah.
So you've got this incoming the AT4 ultimate, the white one.
Remind me shorty, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, standard.
Let's be look.
Pull up.
You're going to pull up my old team.
Yeah, Summit Y, AT4 ultimate.
Yeah, it looks like it's not available to you.
I'll double check the C3.
Yeah, I know.
I was looking at these GMC site.
And it said like the 18 or something delivered to you guys.
Oh, he said, you know, he said maybe a week or a little more else.
So yeah, I know when I was looking at these yesterday,
each one looked like a little bit different.
It's a time when we got put on the train.
Oh, for the delivery.
Yeah.
Is that this one?
So this one, you said that she's kind of by a fork free white.
And I want to go white.
She's like, let's see.
If it's in transit, and you're obviously not smoking for.
So this one was on the light one.
Actually, that's the rail yard.
So it should be here any day.
Right.
Okay.
Is this the one I'm looking at?
It doesn't.
It ends in five, two, two, eight.
Is that the one?
That's the one I'm looking at.
Yep.
Okay.
Yeah.
So when we were also looking at.
Um,
Yeah.
So what, what do you guys need to lock it down basically?
Do you just do the full deal?
Do you just take a positive rise or?
Basically what we do, we kind of just put generic number
together just to make sure we're all on the same page.
And when it shows up, there's no surprises.
Um,
And then we were when it's not here.
We which is $2,000 deposit.
Um, and then here, you know,
interior, we basically just do everything which.
Being a full got the reality yard.
It shows.
So that's the rail yard two days ago.
And I'm actually waiting for another one.
That's on that thing.
You shouldn't.
So it's been Friday.
See, they're going to be here today or tomorrow.
Or it can be sometimes a week or so.
Okay.
So, you know,
And I'm fine.
I'm not sure.
We just got, you know,
this one is hard to find them.
You know,
We're there available and we.
Oh, yeah.
So,
One is three.
We have a list of minutes coming in that are available.
Some clouds that were able to.
Yeah.
Clap your ideas.
So, yeah.
Well, is it easier to find?
Do you need to come over there?
I mean, can you take a deposit or a phone on it?
We can do it over the phone.
Um,
I have a couple of questions for you.
So I can kind of make sure I have all the pieces of the puzzle
See other if you don't mind.
Yeah.
I'm sure.
So first I will just be a craft sealer or finance deal.
You know,
I think it's going to be a cash deal.
No,
Oh,
Mike,
And then note that.
You know,
She does.
She does have a 2018 escalator.
I would think that.
I mean,
It's possible they turn it.
It's possible.
I want to just kind of party it to do.
But.
Okay.
Um,
She had a mean slide.
She just had an email.
So hey,
Let's see the white one.
Okay.
Okay.
Um,
I mean,
We could always kind of figure that part out later.
Generally,
If we have a trade in,
We want to kind of make sure we're on the same page with the trade,
But I mean,
It's been,
It's been off the sell it privately.
Then obviously,
If we gave you number on it,
You didn't like it.
Then if you can tell yourself it's not that big of a deal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So she made a sign that day like,
Hey,
Yeah.
So trade and kind of have you.
Evaluated and see what the number is.
And then she can.
Better for the same,
But I think.
Um,
I think it'll be a cash deal.
So.
Okay.
Um,
I mean,
I know you'll be my contact.
I love her.
I'm sorry,
But any,
There's not.
I'm sure.
There's not.
I'm sure there's not any special financing, right?
Uh,
Right now on the.
I doubt it.
I'll double check your own space.
Do you come or like the least incentivized vehicles?
Just because you can't have them happen.
Kind of like,
Or sell it.
Yeah.
Makes sense.
Yeah.
I think the one time we've never do it.
You know,
There's a zero percent thing for the short term.
That it makes sense.
Yeah.
I think it does.
No.
I just,
I guess you're on it.
So.
Okay.
Um,
I know you'll be my contact for pretty much most of this until you show up.
She's signing.
Yeah.
It'll be under the business name.
It was.
Yeah.
And I would be my next question is,
you know,
I want to get all that information so I can have it all correct in my system.
Yeah.
So,
First,
you at this number,
like,
Uh,
Information might need.
If you got a few minutes,
I can probably just get it all over the phone for me.
Oh,
Yeah.
Sure.
Okay.
First off,
I want to get the name in here.
That's going to be obviously no issue.
What's,
what's her name?
I guess that's the owner of the business.
So I can have that in here.
Her name is Regina.
Art of the IMA.
Let's talk.
L E,
TPAU.
Perfect.
And then what is the name of the company here?
It is N and a C.
Like Nancy,
Nancy,
A C.
Perfect.
Perfect.
And then I have an address in here.
I'm up at right is a 26,
16,
chill code.
Not strange.
That's actually my home address.
I thought the proof.
You have that under the,
have that pop up under the business there?
No, I think he might have.
You may be worked with us at one point or another in the past.
Because so when you,
you include.
My address.
I had a bunch of vehicles out there.
Yeah.
My phone number certainly.
I bought a couple of vehicles from the guys.
Yeah.
It looks like when you,
if you had a box from us in the past.
It looks like you bought a 2015 Acadia from a 2015.
That's probably where it went.
You don't let up.
Yeah.
Well,
I'm going to do this.
Well, I'm going to do this.
And I want to think in because.
Yeah,
I'm going to just create a new lead with.
There.
And so because you bought from us before.
So I don't want to mess up that one.
Yeah.
With my phone number.
But.
Yeah.
What was your last being good?
Sure.
Sure.
I can be sure I have this correct for yards and I'll put you with.
Yeah.
Sternberg.
STERM.
B.
E.
R.
M.
B.
R.
Okay.
Perfect.
I'm just going to create a new inquiry here.
Then with all year and with all their information.
So.
All right.
And then a.
What's the phone number for the business?
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
You're the business.
The business from.
No,
just get her.
That's.
Oh,
I mean,
here's a.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Can you just push up my phone?
Sorry.
Um.
So business memory is actually fine.
Probably stop to keep your number with the contact.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um.
I'm.
North.
Shriver way.
You're.
Uh,
sorry.
North.
Shriver.
Sorry.
Oh,
sorry.
I was sorry.
Yeah.
I was sorry.
Sure.
Sorry.
Perfect.
And then you said, way?
Yeah.
Okay.
And then what does that, it's 83815.
Perfect.
There was me here for a book.
And it was N and AC.
Correct.
Yes.
And AC.
Okay.
Do you happen to know where it's going to be male or if that's some piece and probably get me?
So, eventually I'll need a like register, then the new one with on star and I'll need that at some point.
Which I don't know.
Yeah.
It is.
That's pretty.
Oh, you're on the board.
Okay.
It's pretty.
You're on the board.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty.
That's pretty.
That's pretty.
That's pretty.
That's pretty.
That's pretty.
That's pretty.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, then.
All right.
What I'll do, I'm going to have my boss put me off the quote on the, on the Yukon.
I will.
Um, one, he gets that.
I'll text it over to you so you have it so you can look at all the different ones.
Wouldn't you look at them and the numbers look good to you.
You know, then we'll do a deposit and we'll go from there and like name on it.
Yeah.
Sounds good.
One thing she asked, I mean, it's pretty simple.
I know we could probably do it after Mark figure after the fact, but she wants to do like a black
out M.
Lums, you know, like just the front one of the side badges.
I saw they have.
Yeah.
I don't know if that's something is, you know, you guys just do there, but you know, before we
actually take delivery or how that would work.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think price it out is something that we can.
Something that we can definitely do.
We would probably.
We probably have you guys come in sign for the Yukon.
Yeah.
You all the people working on.
You put it in the paperwork that we're going to do that and then you'll just bring it in
another time to take it that down.
If that's something that would be okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just going to put it in the positive down.
You don't want to do it before we get there.
And then, you know, she had to switch vehicles or something.
Yeah.
Get that.
But no, it makes sense.
But yeah, if you don't mind throwing that onto the quote.
Absolutely.
And then I guess one other thing too.
You know, on the, I have an 84 just in the truck, but she was wondering about the, like
the format.
Is it, it's a full coverage on that, the ultimate.
Sure.
Yeah.
I'm about 95% sure it does come with the full four liners.
I have, I have an Excel version here that I'll go look at to verify.
Oh, yeah.
I believe.
In an estimate.
I think so.
So that's what I'm going to go double check.
And if.
Okay, for every reason if it comes in and it doesn't have all the four liners, we can have those
to do it.
That's not a big deal at all.
Yeah.
I could.
I think that's my game with a full, you know, front and rear or something like, and that's
not even an ultimate.
That's just a.
Yeah.
So like, well, I'm assuming, but I couldn't really find anything.
So.
Well, it's just a four liner.
It's actually like an option.
So you can actually option the four liner package from the factory.
And if it's not option, that way it says come with like the regular, like carpet in that one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You want to feel like liners and if it doesn't come with it, we can always add them.
So it's just a pen.
But.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's not a huge deal.
Yeah.
You know, I just thought we'd kind of put all together at the same time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You text me over when you have it.
And then I'll just.
And pause it.
Yes.
And what I'll do, I'll go double check.
Um, just be it's the, right.
If the need for ultimate that I have comes with them or not.
If it doesn't, then I'll things include those in the quote.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So I know.
And just though I know when I'm pricing out these accessories for the four on yours.
Do we want first, second, third and cargo?
I would thank you now.
Okay.
And then for the,
and then for the max,
I'm sorry.
You want the front and back GMC emblems and all the emblems around it as well.
Yeah.
Okay.
Perfect.
Let me work on this and I will get a quote over a TA guide shortly and then we'll go from there.
Perfect.
Thanks, guys.
Awesome.
Thanks, Greg.
Thanks.
