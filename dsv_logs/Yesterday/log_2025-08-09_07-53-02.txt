Hey, Andrew. It's Michael Munn.
Hey, this is Munn. How are you?
I am good. Thank you. How about yourself?
I cannot complain. Hopefully the weather has been treating you well over there in North Carolina.
We have had a little bit of rain, but it's not too bad at the moment.
That's good. We could use a bit of the wet weather.
It's pretty dry and we're going through a heat wave this weekend and expect triple digits today.
Yikes. Yeah.
We had near that not too long ago, but we had a nice break with some cooler weather and some rain came with it.
But no, things are good.
That's good.
I assume that you're calling to check in. Where are we at?
Yeah. So I think with the final pricing and the, and if you guys can arrange the shipping, I think we can do a deal.
Perfect.
The next steps would be me getting you connected with Carlos, our sales manager.
He will go through the process of paperwork with you.
The last proposal I spent you with the final price of $24,651 in three pennies.
You are confirming your interest at that number. Sorry, which, which was bad.
So that was the last updated proposal I spent you minus recover in with the actual shipping cost,
$1.10 and $0.03. Bring it on your total out of pocket to 24.650.
That looks right. Yep.
Perfect.
What I'll do is I'm going to place you back on a brief hold.
I'm going to go speak with Carlos and see if I can get you on the line with him real quick.
And then I'm going to go pull the car, get it into detail, cleaned up, gas dust, and then we will coordinate the transport to North Carolina.
Sound fair?
Yeah.
Awesome. Thanks for just a moment. Okay, Michael.

Michael, it's Andrew again. Thanks to your patients.
Carlos is currently working a deal. We have a handful of clients here today.
The only thing that I think we need for those back is your social.
If I can get that from you, I'll plug that into our system.
Okay. Are you ready?
I am ready.
All right. And on the text thread that we've been communicating on, if you wouldn't mind sending me a photo of your driver's license, front and back, and then a copy of your insurance provider ID card.
Those would like to be the only last two things we would need.
Okay. All right. Can do that. Wonderful. I'll keep my eyes peeled for that text message and then what I'll do is I'll just get the paperwork started.
I will pull the car and put a sold sign in it and park it out back.
And then once we get confirmation on shipping, take up. I'll have the car prepped and ready for that truck to collect it.
And we'll keep you informed as to information regarding shipping and tracking and all of that.
Okay. That's not just.
And come in just from from paperwork standpoint.
You will provide a title that I can then get my North Carolina registration off of and.
Of course, yeah.
Once we get the fire done.
Yeah. Well,
I'm going to go to the details of getting that to you will likely first class overnight it or first class mail it to you so that you have that upon reception of the vehicle in North Carolina.
All of those finite details we will work out with you. I imagine that you'll probably have a few further conversations with either Carlos or manager or one of our finance managers to lock everything in.
And that works and probably should do it beginning next week just because.
I'm going to be traveling over the weekend but I mean I'll be available if I.
I spelled on that just won't have access.
No worries. I'll make note of that and I'll also inform them of the time difference between us which I'm sure there are where that way without by the way that you know after nine o'clock or anything like that.
I'll be right back somewhere.
Awesome. Well, a happy new card a via.
I will also additionally do a another walk around on it after it's cleaned up and in details.
That way you have a video of it's conditioned before it gets on the truck.
Okay, great.
