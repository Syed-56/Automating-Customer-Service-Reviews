Thanks, call and grant me a few of you.
It's pretty nice.
It's very good.
Can I help you?
Yeah, Derek, are you in sales?
I'm one of the sales managers, or are you interested in the vehicle?
I'm looking online at a vehicle to see if you still have it.
No problem.
Just in case we get disconnected.
Can I get a good name and phone number?
A shell and the number.
Okay.
Got that.
And then what vehicle were you inspired about?
It's a pre-owned 2018 Mercedes SL 450.
I'm almost positive I've seen that when I was pulling into a lot this morning.
So I do believe it's here, but let me confirm that for you.
It's right here.
Are you local?
I'm in a city.
Okay, so you're not too far.
About five hours, four or five hours.
Yeah.
And yes, it is still available.
It's here.
And yes, I've had it at about 14 days.
So it should already be through the shop, which means every car I sell has a 100 year, 100,000 mile power train that we do.
So it's got that on it just because I went through it and inspected it.
So everything should be.
It's a hit.
It's basically a lifetime, 100,000 mile power train.
So we cover all of our motors and transmissions up to 100,000 miles.
So this one, you would be good for about 70, it looks like about 72,000 miles.
So right up the Gillette O'Donnell says 100.
And it doesn't matter how long it takes you to get there.
There is one thing to you're in Oklahoma City.
So that's a real big benefit to local people because we've got stores all over.
but you do need to have an infection done every six months or every 5,000 miles to make sure there's nothing wrong with it.
Oh, okay.
Where do you have that, though?
Well, it needs to be an ASV certified technician.
Now if you get to a crane store, it's covered.
We pay for it and everything.
But it's free.
But if you're trying to keep that warranty and you're outside the area, you've got to pay that technician, whatever his labor time is for the
inspection, you've got to do it every time you change the whole basically, which is, well, every six months, every 5,000 miles.
Okay.
Now what if I don't drive it that five thousand miles?
So if you can do it every six months.
Six months. Yes, ma'am.
So it would matter on there.
Now the thing is, what I usually when I'm talking to someone outside the area is I'm not, I'm not necessarily charging you for it.
But where your piece of mine comes at, if you can get some extended coverages as well.
But where your real piece of mine comes in is that, hey, I didn't just throw a car.
I didn't send it through the washback here and throw it out on the lawn.
I actually put it up on the rack.
And my technician spent about two hours on that car driving it on the list, checking everything for me to give that okay to put a warranty on it.
So it's just a lot of these car dealers I've been doing it a long time.
A lot of these guys changed the whole throw it out on the lot and they never look inside of it.
Oh, right.
So we've been doing it for, you know, this warranty, Mr. Crane's been doing it for, you know, over 50 years now.
And I think what do you expect it to cost every six months?
Okay.
So if you were, well, it'd be numerous to 80s.
If you were to like it, this was me, right?
And, you know, you're going to be paying, you pay a premium already for your old, right?
Because it's a Mercedes.
So, you know, you just expect an extra, an extra $250 on that service when you're getting inspected.
Because it's not just a real quick, you know, it's looking at the price, but not all the way up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, tell me this, I think I read that it has Apple CarPlay.
Okay.
Well, I want to make sure of that.
And then I want to also have you look at the exterior of it and tell me if there are any games or scratches or scrapes or anything like that.
No problem.
Can I do this for you, Shelley?
Can I, can I, is this not?
Yeah.
615, is that a cell phone?
Yeah.
Can I send you, first, you're going to get a message from me that's asking you to opt in.
So, you're just basically going to say yes.
So, if I ever become a pain and you don't want to hear from me again, you just have to hit no or stop.
Stop.
Yeah.
So, but on a serious note, what I can do for you, if you let me put your information into the system here real quick,
I can send you a quick walk around personalized video of it and get close on the paint.
And that way you can see a good visual of like, you know, no pictures or, you know, just walking around the car, which is a way better than just going to go through photos.
I get that, I know, that would give you a good idea.
And then I can also give you any description if I notice anything.
But I'm not mistaken.
Yeah.
This car was traded in here.
I actually, I think I'm the one that might have traded for it or is one of the other two managers.
And it's been garage kept.
It was the extra car.
You know, it is, it is a maculant.
Well, I mean, I, I, I, I'm here.
I want you to be disappointed.
Yes, ma'am.
And then also if you can get inside it, turn it on and make sure it has apple car.
Yes, that's another thing.
Yeah.
What's hard about these is that getting a BMW window stick or sometimes tough.
So I'll have to go out there and actually make sure it has it for you.
Because sometimes those options can be a little tricky on these models.
Oh, yeah.
It says it does, but you know, I just want to never know.
Okay.
I actually bought a car long distance one time.
And they told me it had apple car play and it did not when it came in and,
you know, what a mask.
Yeah.
I understand.
Now, I'll also check to see if it's the wireless or the wired kind.
So yeah.
Absolutely.
They're both.
I know that.
Mm hmm.
I put it in my car.
What's your, what's your, what's your last name, Kelly?
Pet.
H E T T.
Okay.
Shelley is a H G L L E Y and H E T T.
Yeah.
Perfect.
All right.
All right.
I'm going to get this message sent out over to you and I'll give a video for you.
I'll even start it up.
That's a good idea to have a video for you here.
It's starting up as well.
And you know, it's, it's a thing is, it's been really good shape.
So.
But.
And I also want to know, I think they already got on here and figured that out.
But.
The.
Albed door price with tax and title and licensing.
And you probably should have my zip code in order to get the right tax.
Well, this is the thing with that.
Are you, what state did you say you're in Oklahoma?
I'm Oklahoma City.
So, so you being in Oklahoma.
This is the deal.
And Arkansas, we don't collect sales tax at the dealership.
Okay.
So where that's done is that is done.
Are you, are you part of any tribe or nation?
No.
Okay.
So you're going to be registering with the state.
So when you, when you go to rest for this vehicle, you'll pay your taxes then.
And you'll have all your paperwork that you need to do it from there.
We'll make sure it's, we'll make sure your paperwork for that.
Now, if you, if you just need help figuring that out, I don't mind.
Yeah.
And it does just depend.
Are you, are you wanting to pay cash for the vehicle or are you financing?
Well, I got the pens on my husband.
He's not right here right now.
But 15, I have 15,000 down.
Okay.
Now, if he says he'll prompt me the money and everything, we might pay cash.
Or we might use 15,000 down 36 months.
Okay.
Yeah.
Nope.
So short terms.
So term.
So I've got, you know, 27 lenders.
So finding you to write lender based off your credit and the car is not going to be a problem.
I've got.
Yeah.
I've got a credit.
Yeah.
But I don't want you to do a credit check.
No.
I don't want to have my credit.
Yeah.
I'll make a deal with you.
You don't give me your social until you're ready for me to pull your credit.
And then I won't do it.
Okay.
So no, that's I usually usually when I ask for your credit is because we're already agreeing on numbers.
But what we'll do is I can give you this video.
Let's make sure you like it.
Yeah.
And we'll go from there.
Okay.
Okay.
Derek, I appreciate that.
Okay.
No problem.
And I'll tell you one last question.
If we get this all worked out and you love the car and the numbers work and everything,
what when do you think you could come to the dealership?
Well, pretty soon.
Okay.
We just have to find somebody take care of our little doggies.
No, the fur baby.
We have three fur babies and we would want to bring them along.
What kind of dog are they?
Oh, they're all little ones of Westy and ones of Lakey and ones a cavalier.
I've got two miniature snazors at home.
Oh, man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My life you look like a little snazor.
So, yeah.
We don't want to take them in the sheet.
Yeah, it's too hot for that.
I just got to find a dogster and so other than that, if I like it, we could get over there pretty
sure.
Okay.
All right.
Well, I always know everyone this, Shelley.
When we do work numbers over the phone, you know, I'm one of the managers.
I'm really going to get you involved once once you see the card.
You like it.
I'll get you involved with a salesperson to go through the process.
But to lock a vehicle down, we do take partial payments.
Okay.
Sure.
So once you decide that you want this car, I always tell people so they don't feel like I'm
pressure them in the moment.
I like to tell you before we go over the numbers.
If you want to lock the car down to keep from anyone else from behind it, you just have to put
a partial payment down.
But don't do that until you're for sure it's what you want.
Okay.
Absolutely.
All right.
Shelley, I'm going to get this message sent out to you.
Just hit yes to me real quick.
And then what you do that, I'll be able to send you another message.
You won't let me talk to you until I do that though.
Okay.
All right.
Sam's good there.
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right.
