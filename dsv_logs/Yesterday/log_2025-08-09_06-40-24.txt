Hello, Randy.

Oh, yes, yes.
Yeah, I got an email that asked me the week that, but if you had questions on the fee, I 500 fee,
we have.
Yes, when I, yeah, yeah.
That's the only vehicle that you have there, that model.
The only 500 fee, yes.
Well, I don't know about E.
I didn't realize it was electric, but this is for my daughter, so I'm trying to,
say, I'm waiting to hear back from her of electric advice.
I'm not sure if she's looking to replace the car, she's just total, which is a, oh, no.
She'll be right here.
Yeah, she's okay.
I think about a week ago, she's had a 50 bar to do the 2015.
Oh, wow.
500, so she became a very attached owner.
I mean, she's found another one that's like a green color, but they, she didn't, I guess,
get it in time.
And he got gold, so.
I don't know if she's interested in the electric or you ever considered.
So I'm just waiting to hear back from her.
Yeah, in the, I'd like that.
That's the only one that I, that I have, the only other, even fee that I have.
It's a fighter.
It looks like the BMW, the, the, the, the, the, the road service room.
Yeah, a little convertible.
Yeah.
The people are looking at the Z4 or Mavania.
Oh, exactly.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I got a few thousand, 17, one of those, but the, but the fee that model, but you're
looking at that 500, the E is the only one I have right now in stock.
How much is the fighter?
Spider is, let's see, it was originally 19,000 on air for 17,000 by the 30,000,
30,000, yeah, 39,000 miles on it.
Super low.
Not bad.
She was just looking at a 36,000, 36,000 mile.
Miata.
The same design, almost the same design, I guess.
But I mean, you also, it's turned out to be like a bad vehicle for, um, diagnostics.
They just, somebody, the previous owner had different modifications and it, it misfires.
Oh, yeah.
People do that.
This, this is, this has been through our, this is been through our, this is a really nice
clean looking car.
This is a link to it.
You know, I don't know if she prefers automatic or manual.
Uh, so you've never had manual and everything.
She's, she's finding this manual.
Yeah, so I think she will appreciate the,
Okay.
Yeah, this is a good.
Okay.
Oh, good.
Okay.
So I think you a text message that asked me that asked you
that are if it's okay, but text, you can use this text that,
and yes, for that.
And I can text through the length of this.
No one just a, for a.
So you're in Portland, right?
Hillboro, yeah, Portland area.
Oh, area out under.
Yeah.

Yeah.
There it is.
This is Farmer.
I'm training.
Here comes the link right back after.
Or, let me, uh, that's not, that link's gonna be difficult to open.
Let me get you a different, different version of that.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
The second person I've run into today that you're having an accident.
Like, oh, I've had a customer of mine here.
Sometimes a little bit just have an accident.
Oh, wow.
Okay.
So there we are.
Yeah.
She personally 30 cars.
She's already had two previous racks.
Oh, no, one for this rack and they're hardly in dance.
Just like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
The theater built, they're built well.
You know, um, I've owned Jewish me me out of it, but I've looked at these.
I tell you, this is, I think it's a better built vehicle.
That even though I'm a fighter.
Oh, really?
I think so.
Oh, good.
I mean, I, I've driven, I've driven a couple of them.
I've driven the meowas.
And this is a spider.
I'm opening it right now.
Sure.
Or I think it's like a metallic gray or silver.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's nice.
Very nice.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
It's, it's really, I mean, if I was looking for a car like this, this would definitely be very close to the top of my list.
Now I can't think of anything.
I've got that would be, that would be like the right.
Sure.
And then carriers are super nice to me as well.
Okay.
You're 39,000.
What's the, you know, I could have, I don't know.
Um, I'm looking for the one owner.
Yeah.
They're very, very damaged.
That's what maintenance crew does.
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
You didn't, it's the way you want to car back, right?
Super boring.
Sorry.
Sorry.
The back is exactly.
Yeah.
I'm going to keep this thought over to her and hope to see what it was.
Yeah.
This is a deal.
This is a good deal.
And it's a force car, the frame design does.
She likes, but she's got a lot of love with that meowas as well.
Yeah.
Sure.
Now it could be something that was not what she wanted to.
Was it a good car for you?
Big deal of diagnostic on it just now.
And no.
That's just a misfire.
Oh, sorry.
Now.
Yeah.
I never take a look at that.
And where did she live?
Uh, she's just moved in with somebody.
So they're important.
I'm not sure where though.
Okay.
Yeah.
She's going to get back to me with that.
This is well, Phil.
I'm waiting to hear back.
I'm going to go ahead and just support this link to her.
See what she thinks about this car.
Yeah.
And you're always, I'm going to text you right now my information.
And you can forward this as well because it has our address and everything on it.
Love.
Okay.
There.
And we're in auto groups.
So cars are all over the place.
They're we have a bunch of different locations and storage lots and things like that.
So I would need to kind of plan ahead once you wanted to see it to make sure that the vehicle was going to be here and ready to be seen.
You know, if you might show up and someone I had somewhere a customer sure if
looking to be the cold the other day and someone from another duty for the government taking it to Wilsonville.
We didn't know you were coming so we weren't ready.
We could get here in the cars now here.
So.
But yeah.
So I can work with her and make sure that we're getting have an appointment that, you know, she expected and the car is ready.
And so you can look at it and drive it.
And I think you're really like it.
I guess I've driven these cars multiple times.
I'm pretty familiar with them.
And this was the automatic.
And so it was making it more convenient.
And be it a hilly city.
I'm scared of respect.
Yeah.
You know,
Yeah.
That's not the way you want to meet your neighbors.
I'm backing into them on a hill, right?
Yeah.
I hate how you take off on an incline when I'm looking up in the sky and trying to take off.
Yeah.
You're trying to figure out where you're at and where you're going at the same time.
The guy in the man is the clutch and the accelerator and then all gosh, the car right on my back bumper.
So you're just, you know, being zydey getting pretty high.
Yeah.
She has too much of that already.
So.
Yeah.
Oh, worries.
Awesome.

Yeah.
And, uh, I spent being in Kyre area.
I think I sold up in Tyler and the sun was just getting ready to go down as I was getting
ready to cross in Louisiana.
But I mean, I spent being tired or going trying to get across Texas.
I'm sorry.
It was like half of this trip from Southern California to Mississippi was just, you know,
you go through California and then Arizona and then New Mexico and then you go through Texas
and then you keep going through Texas and you keep going through Texas.
And then you go through Texas some more.
