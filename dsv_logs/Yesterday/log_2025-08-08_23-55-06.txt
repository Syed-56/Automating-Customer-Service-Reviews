What are we doing on this Christmas, Mr. C?
Hey, Chris, I'm looking to speak with a sales representative about discovery.
Is you guys having a lot?
Sure.
We have a Christmas here.
Do you have a stuff number to a body shirt?
I believe so.
It is, uh, you ready?
Hold on a second.
Okay, go ahead.
EJRL240931.
So 24 sort of hard discovery.
Is this Shrante?
12, yeah, that one's here.
It is available.
Okay.
So I'm looking for something for my wife.
We've been going back and forth between the P360 and the P300.
I like the P360 because of the grand gym.
And I think that comes with the little,
do you know what is not included on just on the S model that is on the dynamic SE trim?
What the difference is by chance?
Uh, so the front has more of a parent's package.
Because you can get it to everything added to an S and they can look like a dynamic.
But the dynamic has a more aggressive front bumper.
So like that, front bumper will have like the three lines on the corners.
To make it look a little bit more.
Yeah.
Because in the bottom part will be paint matched instead of having the, um,
the matte finish on the bottom.
Just a little bit of a different appearance package.
And then the interior, you know, has two tone options where the S and X comes with a one.
Yeah.
I think you can actually get that.
You tone it out now.
So it's really just a exterior, a exterior package, a parent's package.
Okay.
And then the color here, like what it looks like in, in person.
It's got like a slippery grayish brown kind of thing.
Yeah.
It's like a pewter.
So it's like when you look at it, it looks gray.
And then like on over cafes, sometimes when the fun is directly,
you'll see all the metal flake and I'll have like that.
Um, like pewter color to it.
Okay.
Nice.
So it's a pretty color.
And then this one has a wood trim on the interior.
Has an upgraded sound.
All the other packages for you.
Okay.
Um, so I'm in St. Louis Missouri.
So I'm saying can't come and drive it.
Are there any, um,
dense stings, scratches?
I mean, I know obviously it's certified.
So it's gone through a lot of stuff.
But during the climate.
Yeah.
We try catch.
We try catch.
And all that I can do is I can, um, text you like a, a walk around video of anything.
Okay.
So do all the information that way.
And then that way can review it and see, um,
see if you want to move forward on it.
Yeah.
That would be, that'd be great.
And I've been going through this process of my life, like the past three weeks.
Um, we were set on a BMW X seven and then she was like,
um, phone, phone, send enough money.
So, um, now I need to get this project done and often my plate.
Yeah.
So I'm looking to try to move forward quickly.
It's possible on pre-approved financing through my credit union.
That finance part of it paid, you know, cash for part of it.
Um, but I can finance for you if there's any benefit to that.
If it's just going to be the same rate, I'd rather just,
better rather just finance through my credit union.
Um, yeah.
What's pretty competitive?
And with our location with corporate loans,
they don't let me do out of fate outside financing,
but you can always re-finear it.
You know, whenever you want with no penalties or fees.
So you always have that option.
But we're pretty competitive to be upfront.
We usually are able to, to get to something that's similar or better.
What was your name?
Okay.
My name is Corey.
Sorry, I'm probably for the ones at that.
See why you're why.
And in the last name, Corey.
It's a checker, S-C-H-A-E-C-H-E-R.
Okay.
And then what was your zip code out there?
6-3-1-2-4.
And you said you're on the Missouri side?
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Let me get this, uh, send out to you.
And then, um, just for some more phone numbers now.
Yeah, I have.
3-2-6-3.
Yep.
That's right.
All right.
I'll get this out to you shortly.
And let me ask you this.
We're just planning on, um, uh, try to, I'm picking up, or we're just planning on getting it like that.
Yeah.
I get it shipped.
But I don't know if you guys have a preferred shipping partner you work with or if I need to, you know, get a close from Montway or something.
But either way, I can get you a close.
If you want to go through yours, it's, it's completely empty.
And you can get me a close.
And I'll just plug it in real quick to, as Montway's what I can see with a quote as well.
Okay.
And I can, we can go that way.
I don't know if it's possible, you know, I bought my car from George the last year.
They agreed to support shipping with me.
And I don't know if that's something you guys would consider.
But certainly would help with my decision making.
So, um, of course.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's all good.
Let me give this up here.
And we can get a go from there.
All right.
Thanks.
Okay.
