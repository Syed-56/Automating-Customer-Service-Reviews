Thank you for calling Martin Toyota.
This is the week that instills me from my speaking with, please.
My name is Cindy Heyman, so calling for Deanna's Gospel.
Here's me on my one moment.
Thank you for calling Martin Toyota.
This is Giannis.
How are we doing?
Hi, this is Cindy Heyman.
Good to you.
I'm feeling good, thank you.
How is this calling you back?
Yes, I know.
I was really trying to hear a little bit.
It looks like you were wondering if I went through and asked the chorus pain in hybrid.
So I am going to be for our gift for me.
I know we were my husband and I drove on the Toyota lot and went from sale on this probably
been about two or three weeks ago.
And I know that there's a lot of cards that are already sold and the inventory you've got
to come, but there's not a lot.
So I'm the type of person I buy a car.
I'm going to buy one and it I'm buying one.
The inventory is the shirt and it's going to be a Toyota.
I'm sure.
I know I'm buying the car, I'm getting the bonus at work and so I'm a decal and I'm going
to buy it.
But I keep the car for a long time.
I've had the one I have now that it's for 10 years that I have five grandchildren,
all five lawyers and one which is four million.
So whenever I buy I need to be able to be able to put my grandkids in that car.
Does that make sense?
No you didn't make sense.
And so I like to man that I'm not really kind of a man person.
But I was looking at this and I want a hybrid and I'll do that.
Does this the Toyota and the Land Cruiser come in a hybrid?
Yes, for both of those vehicles are exclusively hybrid.
Okay.
Now, these examples that covered in gas
would be your high-lander and grain highlander.
Those you can get the gas or high-bridge
on all of our other thorough vehicles, those are exclusively hybrid.
Which is, that means they do both, right?
Yeah.
So, the supply of electrical employees, yeah, right.
That's what the hybrid is.
So, the co-workers, just hybrid, land cruiser, is just hybrid.
And the key-inas are just hybrid.
Those three vehicles, if you see one, they're all hybrid.
The highlander and grain highlander, those come in just gas or hybrid.
Okay.
And the gas is probably a little bit cheaper, right?
Correct.
And those are the high-bridge.
So, let me ask you something.
I don't think that land cruiser is going to accommodate.
I like to boast that I don't know that.
That land cruiser is really pretty domain.
It is.
But the ones including not a third row.
Because they put the hybrid battery in the back so you cannot get a link to it in a third row.
Okay.
So, the decois, what's the dip?
I'm sure that's the quarter cost a little bit more.
I'm sure I left on my website.
They're about the same.
So, if I'm interested in getting one,
do I need to go ahead and go ahead and do I need to put my order in?
Like, how does that going to work?
So, are we going to order?
We put in a request of Toyota.
Basically, you just play everything that's more to spoil.
your color combination, the packages you want and something like that.
We put in a request for a letter that says, hey, without a customer, who wants us to call you.
I'm just, you know, don't have to go.
Once the quality cap is down in ice cap or one short profile size or black interior
and she wants technology back to the cost of money.
And then they work in it to us on our case.
Or, we should get, we said, we are a large logging dealer.
So, if they say you have one that I know that the other has,
that basic example is what we could trade with them and do it like that.
So, those are the ways we kind of do vehicles.
I mean, it is still ordering, but if more so put in a request,
we'll tell you how to get a letter in our holy distance way.
We have, you know, we have a customer and this is what she's got to for.
Okay.
And for buying a new one,
when you buy a new one, do you get, like I did pretty good interest rate?
Yes.
Now, we'll say something equals to have special finance.
And I don't move it to quality of zoos because right now,
we have a 2026 for quality.
We don't have a couple of them.
So those would not have any special finance.
I know it is definitely dependent upon your credit score.
But as the quality is, there's no special finance for those right now.
Now, that's a lot more.
I have an excellent credit score.
So when you say special finance, what does that mean?
So, you know, on certain vehicles,
but with these special finance themselves, anywhere from 1%
and then on a rather different tier.
So, you know, the best credit or two-one, that's the lowest.
And then it goes, you know, every so higher depending on your credit.
Now, we'll say right now, there is a special financing.
The third part is, like, there's no 1% or 2% first employees.
But that's a change because, like I said, you're not looking to buy until the beginning of the year.
So, we'll start getting to close a little bit more.
And they could go ahead and release a special financing.
And just right now, the 2066 are brand new.
And I'm going to say, we only have a final copy.
So, there are no Toyota D and release any special finance at all.
And everybody likes that card, don't they?
That's the guide.
I saw a follow-on there, but I know that there was one on there that they offered 3.9 for a certain kind of car.
But, so what do I do then?
Just come back and just call you when I'm getting ready, when I get ready to warm up.
Yeah, I'm not getting ready to stop.
Maybe like in December time.
I'm going to go ahead and pop it over.
Look at your options across all vehicles.
Whenever you follow the work for you, you need to come in.
I'll get you set up and you know, say we can discuss exactly what you're looking for.
Like I said, if you want to go over a route of ordering, then we can click that request.
And kind of get one.
Or if you want to see, you know, wait for allocation or try to do the training, we could do that as well.
Okay.
I do see a 20, 20-time on your lot.
Yeah, but I will definitely do that, Gianna.
I will definitely keep your in mind and I do a place to use follow-up.
You guys, okay?
Just, man, you have a good one.
Thank you.
