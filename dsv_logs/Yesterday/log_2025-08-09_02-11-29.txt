Transcript:
Thank you for going, Gerald.
While trippy with GMC sales,
just the staff mask from speaking with me.
Apparently, please.
Can you say anything, but I saw a box on that.
Is that Angela?
Can you say it?
Kimberly?
I can really sorry.
That's okay.
Thank you, Kimberly.
And you said Cleveland.
Uh-huh.
All right.
Now I'm gonna help you click Kimberly.
Oh, I, me and my husband got a,
this same litter in the mail.
We had, um, paid out of bank reps.
Okay.
So you're looking to take advantage of our fresh tar program.
You were he.
He told me to call and church if he works about.
So.
Gotcha.
I'm trying to call and see.
Okay.
So you're just trying to some information.
Yeah.
Well, we do have a program that is specifically geared towards helping,
you know, folks that are at the launch bankruptcy and are working
on rebuilding their credit.
So we have lenders that are dedicated to helping with that rebuild process.
So what we would do is send a finance application and, uh,
your husband would fill that out or you fill that out for him and, uh,
get his information in there as far as, um, that goes.
And then my fresh tar team would review that application and send you a
requested list of documents.
Once we received all of those documents.
Um, and we hear the pain and approval for you.
We did just, uh, we did try to come on in and take delivery of a vehicle after he did some death driving.
Okay.
Is that where the, um, location would be though?
Yeah.
If you're in Franklin, Tennessee.
Um, Steve, we're in tough to lose.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well, I have customers that come from, um, different states all the time to take advantage of our program.
Cause we have such great success with it.
And of course, we would schedule an appointment tentatively, but, um,
you wouldn't, you wouldn't come out unless we had a guarantee approval for you.
Okay.
Okay.
Um,
Um,
um,
um,
we're okay.
So what, what do I need to,
is this something that you guys can do the email or is this,
is this,
oh, good.
Yeah.
I can send you,
um, so what I'll do Kimberly,
um, and you said your husband wants to take advantage of the program.
Uh,
okay.
So then what I'll do is, um,
I'll set the profile up under his name,
but I can keep your phone number on there that way.
And we can add his phone number too, but we'll keep your phone number on
her just so that you can kind of be in the loop of what's going on.
And, uh,
sounds like you do the,
the business side of things so far right now.
So we can definitely get,
get the information to you.
Then I can set the link to the finance application.
And, uh,
just to want to fill that out and then submit that and just text me done.
And I'm going to set up the profile.
What's your husband's name, Kimberly?
First, first, please.
What is your name?
First,
okay.
Perfect. Thank you.
All right.
I'm going to set this up for,
uh,
under first the first name.
Okay.
And I'll make sure to put your name on the profile.
Fire and violence.
It'll go down into the streets right outside.
Oh,
where's your,
so in person,
that we'll have to come here.
We'll have to come here.
And what is that,
uh,
there for where you are going to title the vehicle?
35,
where's the robot?
No,
but I'm saying to you.
And it's not.
I'm just going to get out of here.
And if those are the people who have been brought to people who are going to choose from your condition,
so those are the things that are secured.
You know what that you think?
The kind of constant thing, how are the law enforcement, the law and military officials,
to say, what about the jail policy?
All right.
And then we put it down to the table.
Okay.
Okay.
We're doing this, doing not showing the reason that the law is not going to be attached.
So I'm going to get this all sent to you.
And like I said, the appointment will be moved around and confirmed once we have an approval
for you before you come out.
When would be the soonest that you'll be able to come here to Franklin and test drive and
take a delivery of a vehicle if we can approval tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
You could come tomorrow, okay?
I'll say, we can hopefully get you an approval today so that we can get you out here tomorrow.
Okay.
Let me see.
Oh, so in the end, that can be checked in this.
Nothing's worth it.
So we're going to set that up.
What time do you think we worked for you to come in tomorrow?
You want to set it up for like the afternoon?
I need to see how long you would take to get from the solution to your area.
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh.
So.
All right.
I want to tell you what, Kim, really, while we're figuring that out, I'll just set it up for
like one p.m.
And then if we need to leave it earlier or later, we can do that.
And once we figure out how far it is, okay?
Okay.
All right.
And like I said, well, of course, we're not going to ask you to come out until we get the
approval completed.
So any of ourity of danger, have you already had your meeting with the trustees?
I see about these cars, papers near.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll get to go then.
Okay.
These are in June.
Oh, okay.
That's right.
Yeah.
Okay.
I got that.
So that should be set up now.
Oh.
What email address can I put on file to send any documentation to?
Um, this is what you can actually send it to both.
So you can, so I can hear it.
Yeah.
You're going to be the one that does it.
You can just use your email.
This won't really matter for the profile, really.
Oh, he's got to be the one doing it for the car.
Okay.
Gotcha.
Okay.
I have my own visa because he's just trying to get him a vehicle.
Yeah.
What email address did you want me to send it to?
Uh, and then Cleveland does that CLE BLA and E.
Oh, I see.
D E, L A and D.
Oh, I see.
D E, L A and D.
B E.
Okay.
Yeah.
There we go.
Okay.
There we go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
This is.
Okay.
Here you can hear.
Here's the sign.
There's the link.
Here's the sign.
Here's the sign.
Here's the sign.
Here's the sign.
Okay.
So I'm going to send the email.
And it'll just be a link to the finance application.
But I'll also send it as a text message to your phone that way.
However, it's easiest for you to get it filled out.
Sometimes there's some people like it on the email, some people would rather do it right from the cell phone.
So let me see.
Oh, no, that's not the one link.
There we go.
Okay.
And then I'm also going to send it over as a text.
So that email should come through if any moment now.
Okay.
Cool.
Cool.
He's outside.
I hear him and trucked on the weed either.
Oh, he's on.
He's on.
He's on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's so hot.
You got to, you got to do it all the time.
It feels like.
Oh, I'm ready to cold whether to come back personally.
I like the cold.
You don't have to do all that.
I just don't like to be hot.
Honestly, it's not even that I like to cold.
I do like to cold.
I do like to cold.
I still like it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let me see.
Okay.
So I got that.
And I'm going to send.
There we go.
Now that should work.
I appreciate your patience with me while I'm clicking and clicking and doing.
So here is.
I'm going to just end on that.
Says.
My name.
And where I am texting from.
I'm current.
Of course I did it wrong.
Step is my name.
Not.
Whatever that is.
But you know.
The best thing is.
You.
Okay.
There we go.
So that's me.
And.
I wanted to find a application behind that.
So if the email sometimes goes to junk mail.
You can just fill that out through there.
But.
And just like I said, once that's completed.
You're sending a text that says done.
Because I know look for that.
And.
And if you have any questions between now and then, let me know.
Somebody should be reaching out to you.
They'll go over what documents they'll need sent in.
Let me see.
So in this number, okay, to contact for any of those documents
that they need, correct?
Correct.
Okay, perfect.
All right, Kimberly, well, I'm going to go ahead and send this
over to them so that once we get that application filled out,
they can start reviewing, okay?
So you're still got out as soon as you can and let me know
when it's complete.
Okay.
Thank you, Kimberly.
You're welcome.
I'll do it the rest of your day.
We look forward to working with you.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Bye now.
