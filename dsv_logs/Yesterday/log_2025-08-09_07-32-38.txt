Thank you for calling Rascal Ford.
For sales both new and used.
NIO 1 for serving.
For part.
Please hold a moment.
Thank you for calling Rascal Ford.
How can I answer all.
Can I get that you heard, Bill, please?
Give me one moment, please.
Thank you.
This is Michael, last go for it for Rascal.
How can I help you?
My name is Paul.
I'm from the 18th World African 50th.
Okay.
What year was that one?
It's a 2,000 year, the white one.
I think that mine's like 15 five.
Okay.
You said that was the F-150?
Yeah.
Okay.
And it's the one for 26 five, you said?
The one that's 55.
15,000.
15,000.
What's 15,500?
Okay.
15,500.
Okay.
Let's see.
12 miles on it.
Something's both.
Okay.
18, white one?
Yes.
Yes.
I have it.
It's got 160 on it per miles.
Yes.
Yep.
I see that truck right here.
It's my fact that I'm looking at it.
Okay.
I'm looking at it.
Okay.
I'm looking at something in that freight range from my kid.
Okay.
What's the body and stuff on that entire model that this stuff?
A body is fantastic.
It's in a aluminum body.
So you'll never have to worry about rust on that particular truck.
Anything 16 or newer.
Well, technically halfway through 2015, when we started doing that.
Yeah.
Anything in that realm as far as a year, why is it going to be good?
Okay.
I'm looking at the driver's side view door.
It's got an off-hand peeling or something.
And I'm going to put your channel.
I was a some point of drive and I don't want to come take a look at something that's going to be a basket case or something like that.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I didn't get repaired or.
You said by the driver's side door?
Yeah.
The rear door on the driver's side.
Oh, rear door.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'll say a bunch of things going off or something.
That's so huge.
Let me see.
I've seen the same thing you've seen.
But I will do this for you.
I will go out and get you a video of it.
Like a walk around video of that.
And then you can see like full condition and stuff.
You know what I mean?
So if there's any questions at the point, you can let me know.
I am going to do this.
Exterior wise, this truck is absolutely beautiful.
Interior wise, it was a painters truck.
It is well worn interior.
Okay.
Yep.
So just so you know, I had a thing.
Beautiful truck from the exterior.
Like I saw it and I was like, wow, I got to check that one out.
And then I got inside of it.
And it was like, wow.
So yeah.
I mean, just you know, like paint on the interior, the back doors for like the little plug-ins,
that you have to plug in and the other plug-in are gone.
So somebody, you know, just nice and nice to the interior is where the exterior, if that makes any sense.
You know what I mean?
But that's also kind of why it's priced where it is.
You know?
Okay.
Is there a reason that thing to make a deal on that thing?
First wise.
Who?
Maybe.
I would say I would want you to come see it first before, you know what I mean?
And tell me yes for sure.
I want to buy it before I start trying to negotiate over the phone.
Just because that's one that you have to see to tell me for sure you want it or not.
And I will get you a good video of the interior exterior so you can see all the imperfections
inside.
Just because like I'm very upfront.
The last thing I want to do is have you drive all the way out of your from Grand Rapids
or from wherever you're at.
And then tell me.
You didn't tell me.
The interior was screwed up.
You know what I mean?
And then I'm like, well, here it is.
What other drugs do you want to look at?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, but yeah, no.
And especially in that price range, drugs are already fine.
So I will get you over a video of it.
You let me know what you think.
And then if you want to go from there, I've never let you know two to 500 bucks take me away from a cardial.
So if that's what it means to earn your business and that's what it means to earn your business and we'll figure it out.
But if it's thousands of dollars away from you got a 12,000 dollar budget and you're looking at a 15, 5 truck, yeah, we're looking at the wrong truck.
Yeah.
But yeah, we'll figure it out.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
And then you have anything else in that in that price range.
I do.
I have.
Do do do do do.
Just looking at that from 15 or.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So F-150s, personal high.
I have a 19 with 197 on it.
It's a crew cab.
That one there is gray.
I launched my interior for 14, 5.
So $1,000.
I have that 18 that we looked at.
I have a 14, which I can't promise anything about like a rust or anything.
Yeah.
I just wanted because it's 14.
But it does seem like a pretty good truck.
It's like orange.
It's 90,000 miles on it.
It's got the five liter in it.
It is a regular cab though.
So that is the only dump that I'm in this truck.
So it's very, very small interior.
Just the cabin side.
And then do do do do do.
And that one is priced at 18.5.
And then from there I go up to 20.
I have a 2019 F-150 XLC crew cab with 170 on it.
That one has a 3.5 liter instead of the 27.
And that one is black on black.
But I won't have that one available probably for a couple days.
Or like by tomorrow maybe.
Because it looks like it has to go to detail.
So then I have one more.
It's a crew cab.
I sell C 2018 at 20 with 150 on it.
So I have some options for you.
Okay.
Are you there tomorrow?
I am.
I'm here from 96.
So if you want to pop in tomorrow, I'll be more than happy to show you all the trucks that I got.
Honestly, if it was me, I'd probably be leaning more towards like,
I don't know, does he need that full crew cab?
Or is he okay with like an extended cab?
You know, I throw a drill in 16, like it's stomach cabs.
And you know what I didn't like about it.
It's just seems like it was loud on the inside.
And I told you it was just that particular truck or, you know,
or all like that.
It was just, you know, it was like a weird, like kind of like,
you know, almost like when you roll out in a window and you hear that,
like that, that buffering, that weird, you know,
yeah, air sounds.
Which one looks like that?
I'm like, yeah, it's easy.
And I don't know if they're all like that or it's just the one that I drove.
So I will be 100% for inclipia.
If it's for your kid, I would never buy him as a vehicle for your kid,
unless you're a mechanic and you plan on fixing it or something goes wrong.
What I would do on the other hand is spend just a little bit more.
You're already looking in the 15, 5 range, 16, 5 range.
For 21, I have an 18 XLT with 139 on it.
That is certified.
That we have gone through a full inspection, 136 point inspection on.
Also, a 19 with 129 and a 16 with 89,000 miles on it,
all for the same price.
And they're all blue certified through Ford.
So it comes with a 90 day 4000 mile guarantee.
And then, you know, you, you, I can at least say,
I know for sure this is a good truck.
I know for sure my mechanics have looked at it.
They've checked over the whole truck.
They know what normally goes wrong and what breaks, you know what I mean?
And they've checked those parts out of place them with Ford,
only in parts of anything was wrong.
So that's the only thing I would say personally,
if I was looking for a vehicle for my kid, I would just try to spend just a little bit more
and just get something certified.
That way you know, like, hey, I don't have to worry about something down the road.
But I always tell people, if my hands is vehicle,
be prepared to put 500 to 1000 bucks in this thing in the next six months.
And nobody wants to buy a vehicle for 1000s and then go put 1000 bucks into it.
You know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But we can check out all my options when you get it a mile.
I have a ton of trucks.
Like I have just an Apple 150 is alone on my lot.
I'm sitting on 26.
So I definitely have them.
You know?
Yeah.
My thing is, I don't want to buy something too late for them.
You know, they can feel the title, they feel like that.
You know, he says, oh, my man comes out, I would ever say so.
He says, I'm on a box.
So, you know, the kids who work to it, you know, I don't want to buy something too late
because I don't want them to feel that, you know, hey, you know,
just because we can't work, we're going to, you know.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
However, you want to do it, man.
I just assumed that, you know, this might be the better out for it.
You're just going to something certified.
But I do have, you know what I mean?
Mid mile if you don't want 50s, 160s for that, saying, you know, 15, 15 by per fringe.
And so if you have 75, you've got 75, I'm sure where you can make that 18 work for 15.
You know, it's first at 15, five right now.
We've had it for a little while.
We're ready to get rid of this thing, you know.
Yeah.
You know, so if you can do a walk down some pictures, you know,
the smell looks smoke.
I really don't want it.
Fair enough.
You know, that's not me.
I mean, I don't know.
So let me go again if it's just a piece of that pan on or is it like,
I've just been at pain, you know.
Oh, it's everything.
And I, I, yeah, no, I would be the first one.
of the big man that is an awesome truck and then look at the inside and then go,
oh, shoot.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
So yeah, I'm just a very honest.
Okay.
I would much rather start off a good foot than, you know,
hey, yeah, I'm looking at it.
Looking as awesome.
And then you come check it out.
And I'm, you know, like, then let's get a, like a wire, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, that's,
I'm like, you know, what time you.
Nine to six tomorrow.
Okay.
And all that stuff you were talking about online on your website.
Yeah.
Yep.
All those vehicle around mine.
I can,
I will send you a link right now.
Your Paul, right?
Correct.
Okay.
Haters last name,
H-A-Y-T-E-R.
That's correct.
Okay.
Perfect.
I just have already here and you came up in the system.
So, I will log you in here and then send you a video to truck and then
I am scooting out for the day because I got date and date and date.
So, I will call you first thing in the morning and let, you know,
or you can call me a mile and let me know what your thoughts are and what time you're
going to be here and then I'll be ready for you.
I'll hear that because you might.
Fair enough.
