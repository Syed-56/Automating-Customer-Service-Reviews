I'm a little bit more final and that's why we're playing for you by the same.
You know, the other part is a little bit of a better build and a nice deck.
This part is a little bit less than fire.
Sorry.
It has not been so good for me somewhere else, but we just want to go and get back to our now and see if they'll see them.
I don't do that.
Thanks for holding this, Josh.
Hi, Josh. This is Erica. I'm Jason Sond.
Yeah.
You guys are just in here?
We're supposed to be helping us.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
And you are a sales guy, right, Josh?
I'm one of the personal sales managers.
Yeah.
I'm the one you were talking to.
Were you the one that came in?
Or were you the one that we drove the car with?
No, that's Aaron. That's who you chose the car with.
The sales rep.
Oh, okay. Perfect.
Okay. So I have one question for you.
We didn't take that paper that you gave us, but can you tell me what was that price?
Was it 26 something or 27 something?
What was that price that that we were at with the 21 five and you were going to take 600 off or something?
What was that base price?
Let me, let me get it right now.
We were at 27, 4, 55.
And yeah, I was going to try to split the difference another 600 with you to get to like 26 nine or 26 eight.
I can take a picture, you know, because so far we had,
we had this down at a total of 44.
So let me just let me just ask you something. I'm sorry.
So basically there's another vehicle she likes to, but that has a little bit more mild on it,
but she does like the colors light and it's got red seats, but.
Is it a CPU or is that a bad idea?
Yeah, I have another.
I think it's in Tempe. I'm not sure exactly where it was.
And he haven't gone and looked at it, but she's talked to the gentleman on the phone.
And but she liked you guys because of the miles on the car.
It was just a little less mild. I mean, anyways, bottom line is this is my daughter wants to buy a car.
She is trying to through this on her own.
This is her first car.
You had a certain amount saved up. That's why it's hard for her to keep going over into something that, you know,
she doesn't want to go over with like the cost. Anyway, so.
If for whatever reason, because these are going to get a car tomorrow and it's either going to be that one with the rest seats or it's going to be your guys's car.
And I told her that I would call you because she's working. She's had a good work at five.
But is there any way that you can do.
26 five.
With somehow doing this, the sale of the price for that one cost.
And if we were to go in there tomorrow afternoon, do you think with that interest rate you said on that thing? Do you think we could go from there?
So I'll buy you get the 26 five total off the door. So.
And I'm going to loan her the money. Yes, because we're going to loan her the money and we're going to give it to her.
If you can do that, it's not the other car is cheaper because it has more miles on it. Okay. And that's in her price range. And she actually likes it a little bit better.
But we're trying to explain to her that you guys just told us today because we didn't even know about that manufacturer warranty.
We just explained that that it has lower miles and this would probably be a little bit better for you, you know what I mean.
And so if you can do that, we're willing to just give her that little bit extra that she doesn't have.
Okay. We're not like we're trying to build our can to deal with you guys.
The price to be in her price range of that she's trying to do.
Right. And then what was she putting as far as a down?
Does the do you want me to still the show 035 and 5 if I can do the 26 five alphabet? No.
No. She's going to be putting about 5,000.
Okay. Let me see if I can get the 26 five alphabet or and then I'll re send it with zero down and then 5,000 down.
So you can see what it would roughly be with the payments.
Perfect. You could do that. I would very much appreciate it. And then if you want to.
Excuse me. Yeah. What's your number?
My number.
And your first name again?
Sorry. My name is Erica.
Erica. Okay.
The.
I'm a.
Me.
It's got it with the desk manager and if we can figure this out for you guys.
Okay.
I'm not out there and reach out to you. If we can, what time tomorrow would you say works to get all the draft up?
Um, probably what time do you guys open?
We open at eight. I mean, if you want to be here by.
Oh, okay. Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, you're ready for me.
Better for me.
Okay. So I'll just tell her that when she comes home, she has to go to bed so that she can get up early.
So.
Yeah. I would just start to be on the.
Ten o'clock.
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah.
We're there.
I will.
Okay.
Okay. I'll try to be there as early as I can.
Okay. Well, let me see if I can do this.
And then we'll respect up to you. Okay.
