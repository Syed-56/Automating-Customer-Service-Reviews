I'm supposed to come tomorrow, but I'm out this way.
So I'm my work.
Yes.
You know.
Hold on.
Tell me.
You think about coming today instead of tomorrow then?

I'm on this side of the town, but let's stay away on the west side.
So I'm right on the train player.
Oh, okay.
And see if an opportunity is coming on.
You know, see it right now.
So if I take 90 and get off on this road, where do I make a right or left?
Oh, give me one second, William.
I'm so terrible at directions.
Would you?
I'm assuming you'd be coming from the west side.
So you'd be coming.
So you'd be getting off.
When you get off, okay, here we go.
Yeah.
Maybe you're going to go right.
Really, right off to the exit.
Oh, I'm supposed to go right inside.
Right.
You know, do you know when the Duncan is on this approach or the like the Aldi?
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
We're right across the street from the Duncan and Aldi.
So when you get off the 90 exit, you're going to make a right and really right by the exit.
You really can't miss us.
We're going to be, when you make a right, you're going to be on your right.
Okay.
I think I know where you top them off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're right next to the right across the street from the Duncan, Aldi.

And it looks like we do still have the Jesus available.
So we'll be all set for you.
Thank you.
I have both.
