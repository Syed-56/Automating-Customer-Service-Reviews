I think you're calling to somebody say, James, the card or lack, this is Candice.
How can I help you?
Hi, it's Robert.
I'm currently here in my mother-in-law.
We're calling on her.
I look for a card today.
We sent out an application for her on my own.
Okay.
Were you already speaking to somebody who had our dealership already?
No, not yet.
Okay.
I'm ready.
What was the vehicle that she was interested in?
This is the train.
This train.
Okay.
And we were interested in the first-time dialysis program.
That's what she wanted to see.
Okay.
I do have these currently in stock and on the lot with some great discounts on these.
Were you pointing off something in some time today with her?
Actually, we're not mobile because the card we have right now is the six-series parable.
And we're not mobile.
You're not in.
You're not in.
You're not mobile.
You're not mobile.
You're not mobile.
You're not the moment.
Okay.
So how can I help you?
Well, we wanted to see if we could get her into the first-time virus program.
And see if we could get into the...
It maybe perhaps today.
Okay.
Yeah.
I mean, I can send over a credit application to you via text or email.
It's up to you.
Whatever works best for you.
And then I will need a stock number of the vehicle that she is interested in.
I can send that over to you as well via text or email, like with our current inventory.
And then you can just let you know what stock number that she's interested in.
And then, you know, we can go from there on how we can.
Obviously, you know, you guys can make it down in store to sign people where it gets to become
an agreement.
Is that right?
Yes.
Okay.
Sounds good.
All right.
What was your first name again?
Oh, my name is Carrie.
I can be on the monitor.
You can do some other stuff.
And her name is Andrea Pergy.
And then, so I'm going to be conversing with you.
Is that right?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
I think they got it.
Okay.
Let me go ahead and put that.
What is her zip code?
It is 9, 2, 4, or 5.
Okay.
And then what's she going to be purchasing?
Great.
I am.
I am.
If you want to do, if you're doing challenges of first time by program.
I would think about leasing.
What the buyers would be, you know, purchased.
I'm leasing your kind of, you know, renting the vehicle for several years, right?
Technical.
So let me go ahead.
I'm going to get you a sales rep and a Paris.
I would think you can take that information and get numbers sorted for you.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm going to do an idea.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you so much for holding Paris.
I'm going to pat you over to Eric.
He's going to be assisting you with everything.
Okay.
Thank you for that.
It is a problem coach in my future, stating that this is very important.
I hope you.
Yes, I am.
I am a Paris and this is my mother-in-law, Andrea and for Jesus.
Hello.
We were getting everything situated with her children's purchase at the vehicle.
And we were looking at the first time buyers, programs used to go and go and on.
And we were interested in the terrain.
I see there is some one of them there.
Pretty good.
There is a particular color that you are looking for for that vehicle.
Anything but silver.
And we were interested in black on black, white, and white.
All right.
So it was a black on black that you saw.
Yeah, it was black.
Yeah, it was black.
All right.
First I got one right here.
And then how much is gone?
Where are you thinking about putting it down?
Okay, right now.
I'm going to go ahead and, um, to our hair takers.
So I'm going to go ahead and, um, I have money that I'm receiving from my settlement.
And it's really like, well, it's quite a police second.
So, um, I'm going to look for down at least 2,000 to 2,500.
Um, the day and then we maybe could just do like a defer pay.
Or something like that.
But I'm sure to give it.
I have my contract and everything I can also put in.
Let's go.
See, I'll be bitten.
Okay, perfect.
Sounds good.
And then you want me to send to text you over the credit application.
Or when it comes to a monthly payment where you are thinking about when you can fill my
statement.
Um, well, I want to see, um, we're kind of doing guys can work as we, we're open because, um, right now,
like I said, we take care of her.
And she really doesn't have, um, any rent to pay here.
So, you know, you know, get it pretty good.
Yeah, because on a vehicle, like there's something like the terrain here, your monthly payment on one of these
or polyds, lecking, you know, on a post credit, it's going to be pushing roughly between
six eighty to around seven ninety.
Um, on one of these right here.
Yeah.
Really?
Do the first time buyers program?
Yeah, correct.
Mm.
I'm not down.
I'm not down.
You said like six eighty.
Six thousand?
No.
Six hundred.
And those three thousand months.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Five forty.
Hello.
Yeah.
I'm so here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think.
Okay.
So, maybe.
Mm-hmm.
Might be a little too.
Um, well, how long was that being?
It would be roughly for 72 to 84 months.
It just depends on the approval that we do get.
Right?
Um, also.
What, well, what nothing can be did to have in mind?
Was it for you?
Yeah.
You're going to, number five something.
Okay.
For sure.
Let's see.
Because if you're open, also, we might have a couple preon vehicles.
Right?
So, we're going to do something.
Okay.
So, we're going to do something.
Okay.
Okay.
So, let me do this.
I'll text you over our credit application.
Right.
I'll have you still flat out.
And then once you're done, right, you could just let me know via text.
I'll text you over to your right now.
And then we'll start working.
Okay.
So, we're going to do something.
Okay.
So, we're going to do something.
Okay.
I'm looking at the user in this retail.
You're going to stay in.
What should we work at?
I would say if you're lucky enough to use inventory.
Say under 25,000.
So, we can roughly drop on a computer.
Yeah.
I'm looking at the user in this retail.
You're going to stay in.
But should we work at?
So, I would say if you're lucky enough to use inventory.
I would say stay under 25,000.
Right.
So, we can roughly drop on a computer.
You're looking at the app.
I think something was between five actually and it was about round about that.
So I'm going to go ahead and look again and we'll go from there, right?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Okay, your name again?
My name is Eric.
Eric, thank you so much.
Yeah, no problem.
Well, talk to you, it's an okay.
Okay, for that.
All right.
