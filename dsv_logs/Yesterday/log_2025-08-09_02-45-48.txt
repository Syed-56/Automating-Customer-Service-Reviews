We are placed in Stewart.
Do you guys have to do this.
Do you add into.
Yeah.
We're a volume dealership.
So we add a.
A dealer fee of 995 which is also a documentation fee.

I got you.
All right.
I was just curious.
I just like that vehicle for the place you guys have listed.
I just want to make sure I didn't come down there for a different price.
But I'm always not going to be completely different.
That's the starting price for sure.
We're more not a dealership that's just going to screw you over like that.
No.
I got you.
I just I was hoping to pay the 1799 for the car.
But I understand the title and tag and everything and taxes.
I just wanted to.
I wouldn't want to pay the other fee for dealer fee or anything like that.
But that's why we're at Culper's.
