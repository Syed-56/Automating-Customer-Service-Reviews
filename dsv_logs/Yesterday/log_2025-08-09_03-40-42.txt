Thank you for calling Volkswagen a Salem.
Please hold while we connect you to the next available team member.
This call is being recorded.
Hey, hello, David.
Come on, it's all second.
Say, this is Paris speaking.
Hey, how are you doing?
Hey, good.
How can I help you?
I'm all right, man.
I've been to a some start-gen for some vehicles and through myself, Cole.
Did you know that?
He said, my credit jumped up significantly in the past month.
And I'm looking to upgrade my car that I have now.
And when I was 13 through it, it referred me to you guys.
I do have a certain type of car that I like.
And when it's when I seen it, it said to call contact the dealer at
Volkswagen.
Say, that's what I'm doing.
See what I can do.
Yeah, absolutely.
Should you even locally the ceiling here then?
No, I live in Eugene.
OK.
But it must be like a day.
You think you're not.
I'll do the cell code app.
It's basically referred me to cars that would work with me or that would work.
I guess through them.
Don't you?
Yeah, what are you?
It was the record.
Yeah.
Oh, I was looking for this car specifically.
If you guys still have it in stock, it is.
Yeah, the picture.
Is it new?
Freon certified?
I think it is.
Do you know if it's new pre-owned or certified?
Oh, it's pre-owned.
Yes.
It's OK.
So it's a use vehicle.
It's a 2017 Cadillac STS.
Nice looking car, man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it's a STS and the ex-TS will be upgrade for me.
So this one is 100% available.
It is?
It is?
It's available.
Come pick it up today if you want to.
OK.
We're being low with cell code.
We're so personal of our preferred lenders.
OK.
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying.
I do have a trade-in though.
So I want to accept trade-ins?
Of course, man.
OK.
We're doing a little bit of note.
Yeah.
Our give us have set us by thousands of extra dollars for what we call our pull-ahead
programs.
So we're able to offer pretty significant trade-in values.
You can hear it kind of hooves in the car.
I'm not saying you are.
Right.
So a lot of people who bought cars back in like 2022 and stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The cars are docked.
You know, it's hard to pull out of it.
That's kind of.
I can't hear that exactly in my situation.
Because I love the car.
There's nothing wrong with the car I have now.
It's very beautiful.
It's just I want to do a car.
My mind's in 2012.
And I want a lease of 2015 up.
OK.
Well, let's go.
We have 104,000 on my Cadillac SPS.
Like I said, there's nothing wrong with it.
I love that car.
I just love Cadillac Spirit though.
But there's nothing wrong with it.
It's 104,000 miles on it.
I've had it for about two years.
I got it around my birthday two years ago.
It was in the September.
And that's why I had it for about two years.
And now with my birthday coming back around.
And I credit jumped up.
When I got that car, my credit was shot.
It was super low.
I was going in there on a hoping of prayer just to deal with L.A.
And the guy gave me a really, really good deal that I couldn't
refuse.
So I took it off of his hands.
And I've had it ever since kept the maintenance on it, kept
everything that needed to be on it.
So yeah, I was just looking to upgrade.
And that car that I can't do when I was going through silka
and start to through catalytes.
You need that car that you like to have.
I literally screech out of it right there and said I need to talk
to somebody about it.
There you go.
So I think the first step is to look set up a time for you to
come view the car, man.
We can take a look at yours and try to get you as much value
as we can for it.
OK.
OK.
I think we can go back to the next meeting.
I'm going to check the next meeting.
There.
Today.
No, I have weekend golf.
But today I have something to do.
So tomorrow.
No.
No, see.
First today.
Next meeting is the 14th.
What next we can do work?
OK.
Yes, a car skill here.
Yeah.
I'm going to have a better idea of when I get up there because
I said I am in Eugene and I will have to make a trip up there.
OK.
What if we were to slightly different, man?
So I know on our website we try to do a pretty good job of getting
like the walk around features and stuff like that.
Did you have any questions about our car at all?
Did you maybe you know I wanted to know I said it's my birthday
man and that will be just right that I would that I would love
because I've been looking for you know for upgrading my car.
And honestly I didn't know anything about how this process
worked until I want to talk to so-called.
They said yeah, this is you know to our website and these places
basically work with us.
So if one of the car goes to them or not go to them but you know
talk to them about how can you do that about the trading and stuff.
So if I would have to go on to your website and do that.
But I don't know if those over-fardon me through their banking app
then I'm pretty sure that's what this process for.
They're trying to get me financed through them.
Yeah.
And we can make it easier for you.
Like some phones and buildings.
Maybe you would have been candidate for like a remote purchase
is kind of what I'm getting at.
Okay.
And actually it's like if you were able to like give me the
event of your car current miles and then who your pay office
through and how much you owe.
Okay.
I'll be able to look that information up kind of put it against this one.
And then we could do a I'd also probably need a couple pictures
of your prior and then estimate on what its condition is.
Like on a scale of one to ten my parts of seven.
And then these features, you know, here's the flaws.
So it doesn't have that extent.
And then we could kind of book your car out remotely.
We could even send it over.
You know, if we kind of agree on like a ballpark number.
And then you would send her to sell crows.
See what right they would give us.
And we could deliver their car and switch it out.
That'll be better because honestly,
they were telling me also too like it'll be better to look for a car.
I was here but I told them well when I talked to them.
I want I kind of want the car.
That's why I'm on the phone with you because I want that car.
You know, and yeah, I don't know how this is.
I don't know how this works.
I've never tried to been the car matter fact.
I'm just fucking 38 year old.
I just had my license for about two years.
I never really needed license.
I was that around.
So now that I'm working that myself together,
I've been trying to do all the, you know,
the right things to take the right steps.
But I know for sure that if I'm working as hard as I am,
then I want to car that I know I want, you know,
that I will pay for it.
And that's only, it was only for that.
The right pressure I have this for is at 14,
14,200 and I was already paying 10 for this when I had now.
So $4,000 is not big difference to me at all.
Yeah.
And what's the interest rate lower?
Yeah.
And then I'm, you know, now my credit is, you know,
in a good standing I am, I don't know.
I've never, you know, ran it in this good standing.
So that's why I said I don't know how, you know,
you guys work with AP or I don't know that any of that.
How do I go?
So yeah, and it's a little bit cheap.
And it's a super simple process.
What I'll do is I'll give you a name.
I'll send you a text and then send me the information on your trade in.
Once again, I've been miles, you know,
a rating of condition and then your pay off amount or if you don't know that.
Do you know who you currently finance through?
Yeah, I do.
I'll go through Pat West and they were very,
honestly, he said that was the, oh, at that time that was the only place that would accept me.
And he would just tell me that they would, you know, stay with them.
But now that my credit with almost 150 points from when I got the car,
they said, oh, yeah, we'll definitely let you finance through us now.
And I said, okay, so how do I go about that?
This is the process they told me when I came from the bank,
they said, look at a car through our app.
We say, look, shop for a car through our app because this is kind of,
you know, we go through them and if you can, if I asked the rest and we can push you in that car.
So that's what I'm doing now.
And I got that.
I'm kind of dead for that one, even though it's kind of far,
but like I said, if you can do that work, you can send the car if we can get all that real range.
That will be perfect for me.
Yes, 2025, man.
What was this totally really current, search it out.
But yeah, I don't have the ability to pull like a payoff from Pat West.
I'll only do this a little bit of footwork and just kind of find out your payoff.
Like do you have a default?
I know for sure.
I tried to start with them after I made my payment.
Not so long ago.
As a factor, I just paid.
I owed them $6,300.
$6,300.
Perfect.
And then as far as your name on my color idea, it comes up with a pretty lengthy name,
see you, or ENO.
And then, oh, no, no, no, that's just my wife is through Metro.
My name is Raymond Henderson.
My name is Raymond Lee Patrick Henderson.
I'm actually.
Raymond Lee Patrick.
Is there the first or the first?
I know Lee Patrick gave like LE then a dash been Patrick.
So is Lee Patrick, Raymond Lee Patrick Henderson.
Yeah, HP and the ER.
So in.
That's Owen.
Okay, perfect.
So you're going to have a kid.
And you got there needs to be a second one of these.
And Raymond Lee Patrick.
I know.
I know.
I'm.
My dad is the second.
His dad is the horse.
I'm the third.
My brother's is the fourth and my son is the fifth.
Man, that's how that name needs to be.
It's like George.
Yeah, we got a whole football team of Raymond is around here.
There you go, man.
I appreciate that.
That's awesome.
Man, I name my parents.
You got to keep that name going.
So hopefully my son and my son and a teacher name this and Raymond.
Man, that's first and first man.
Every time I look at him, but you know,
a couple times a week like,
hey, don't forget, man, when you get a kid,
you got a name and Perry's a third.
Yeah.
That's how you can do it.
I'm going to take people to lie.
You know, yeah.
Perfect.
So I'm going to.
So.
I have the value.
What are you for me?
It's the bin and miles.
So I'm going to put it on.
Okay.
I have the bin number right here.
And I know the knowledge of just in the car last night.
The bin number is.
Oh, it is.
One.
G.
Six.
D is in dog.
Excesses.
Valifold.
Six.
E is an edger.
B is in dog.
One.
B is in boy.
Zero.
One.
Five.
Nine.
One.
Nine.
One.
So the person.
The answer was IT.
Yeah, I see it.
George.
No, they're not one.
Sorry about that.
One.
One.
One.
One.
Six.
D.
One.
B.
Zero.
One.
Five.
Nine.
One.
Nine.
One.
One.
Yeah.
Perfect.
And the miles.
The miles is 6,000.
I mean, one hundred is 6,430.
Perfect.
Okay.
And so let me pull the payoff.
I'll get a rough estimate.
First condition like what would you rate the condition?
One.
One.
The condition.
Nothing wrong with it except for when I went to Portland and I parked it.
It's a very tiny scratch on the bumper at the bottom.
Okay.
No check engine lights on.
No.
No, that's the no.
Yeah.
Everything from what?
From my knowledge.
Everything is right.
I just went and got a service of everything looked right.
Said I went to Florida and took my wife out.
They said, well, now before I went, I went to the elderly and checked it.
They said, everything looked right on it.
And I got a little change.
So yeah, I make sure I keep the Cadillac.
They're clean and up to date as possible because that's not my dad would have it.
Yeah.
There you go.
So let me put a package together, man.
And then once I'm able to verify it, trade in value and everything.
Yeah.
Let me know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let me know.
Yeah.
Let me know.
All you have to do.
Hey, look, this is what, you know, this is looking at.
And if you can, I'm just like that.
I work for Pepsi.
I'm not just trying to trade in that car.
I'm trying to trade it in with some money as well.
So I can, you know, I for sure I know what I want.
You know, like if they say, hey, we need this and we're going to need this.
And I'll have to work on that to build that up to get that with you guys needs.
I need that core.
Yeah.
We first used zero down or something.
Yeah.
Really, I'm not really looking towards that because like I said, you know, people kind of not frown on that.
But they're like, hey, you just want to trade in your car and get this one.
Really.
But yeah, kind of, you know, like, hey, I'll give you back some money.
No problem.
I just need to know what I'm looking at.
And what kind of payments, you know, because I don't want to go away.
Like now you owe $500 a month on something, you know, because I think that will be in the portable.
Yeah.
No, I totally get that, man.
So I'll put together just kind of a rough idea what I think it would be.
And then a lot of it is going to depend on what sell code will give you for an interest rate, right?
Right.
So I can't get anywhere from like 7% all the way up to like 24% right?
Right.
Right.
But that'll be the one variable I could have put together for you yet.
Okay.
And so if we focus on everything else first and then if you like, yeah, let's work on that interest rate.
And I'll send you an app, you'll fill it out.
And then I'll send it over to sell code.
And if everything's good, then I can get you this card tonight.
That man, listen, I'm my birthday coming up and I'll get my whole so.
I really like that card.
And I haven't even seen this.
It's out of my card, but not really.
It's all black leather wood grain, everything.
I haven't even.
I'll go check it out, man.
I'll have someone send you a video.
I'll tell that.
What do you do?
I'm kind of dead set on this car.
My wife said, I mean, they don't.
You have a Cadillac.
I know.
I know.
I know.
But this one is a little bit newer.
And the body shape of the XCS is just a maximally to me.
I like the SPS.
It's kind of like a girl core.
It's not big enough for me.
Gotcha.
I had a big boy if you were for a while.
Yeah.
And I had a Cadillac to build before this one.
I had a big one.
I had a big one.
The wheels.
So I have a Batman car, man.
And I'm like, this is small.
I told my wife, I just, it's very small.
You know, I, I think it's a little bit bigger.
Now, there's just something cool about those cars.
All right, give me a few minutes and I'll reach out to you.
Okay?
All right, thank you very much.
Yeah, thanks for the opportunity, man.
I appreciate you.
No problem, man.
Let's do some minutes.
Yeah, touch it.
Bye.
Bye.
Okay.
