I'm Joe Sherman, I hope you'll see.
Hi, I'm Michael Kagan.
I'm trying to sell this person a dollar,
at least an hour to use MDX.
Yeah, do all those right?
Yeah, interested in the all-road drivers,
and if you guys got it.
Yeah, we do have the code.
So I live in the Bay Area,
and I was kind of hoping I could basically
walk you through the numbers I'm interested in,
and if that's a price that we can find,
and we'll put it down to the positive
and you can pick it up either this weekend or early next week.
Does that work for you?
Yeah.
Okay.
Now, I'm spending with Michael.
All the road drive, accuracy, ZGX,
color on a different one.
I'm interested in the 24 months,
7,500 mile resawption.
One pane.
And looking for not to go a price of 8500.
8500,
it was, we had the program before,
but now it's going to be higher.
On a 24 month.
And I'll just read our books.
Yeah, just for a second, I'll just go.
Also, FYI qualify for the load of units,
and then I could go and ask you guys.
Yeah, this has to be a load of the rail for you.
Wish type of car you have in our phone.
It's a 20, I think 12, I hear,
20 years to be 20, five,
or you have something.
Yeah, it's newer than 25.
No, 20, 15, 15.
I don't think it's for that,
not for the actors.
There's actually less.
But conquest, that's where it is, but for the local.
I think it's, yeah.
Yeah, but I've got to act here.
So it's, it's loyalty.
It's not conquest.
Yeah, but you have to be like newer than 25,
15 for the loyalty.
Not for loyalty.
Not, not, don't need to be rude,
but for loyalty doesn't,
it doesn't need to be.
For loyalty, it's, uh, less.
You can be older and something.
I'm looking at that,
I'm looking at it right now on the website.
Okay, okay,
I'm going to take you to the numbers.
Okay, thank you.
You're welcome.
