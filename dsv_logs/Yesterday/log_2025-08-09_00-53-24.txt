Transcript:
Thank you for calling Parkmaster.
How may I direct your call?
I just need to talk to somebody from sales.
Yeah, for sure.
Have you been speaking with any of our sales reps before?
Not at this time. I just have a quick question.
I'm doing my research online and something's not clear to me on it.
So how's your interest in lumen here?
I'll connect you with someone.
Okay.
I'm just going to take a look.
Take a hold of you.
Who am I speaking with?
I am.
This is Curtis Pauling.
I think it's a good time comparing places as a CX5 online.
Of course, it is a big part of that.
I see installed on which is package AA00.
Okay.
Okay.
I just submitted a little read as well.
I'm just, uh, so the AA00 is just like the C entry code for that vehicle.
It's nothing additional.
It's a track performance.
It's like being so, like, it's a G.P.
That's what it is.
It's a G.S.
It's a C-S.
It's a C-like entry level code for that trim level.
Okay.
So it's based, it's code word for no package.
It's not nothing else exactly.
Yeah.
It's just the trim levels.
I don't think it's G.T.
It's not the extra on it, I think.
Okay.
Do any of your CX5 block users installed?
No.
It doesn't come standard because there are all sorts of terms of pens.
So none of them are, uh, come standard with it.
It's an easy install.
Okay.
Um, so, just like I told you, I've been comparing places around.
Right.
Um, one thing that, uh, but I haven't been able to get a clear answer on from some is if,
I already get the G.T.
I've been told the G.T. block users had a problem and they just fixed it like a week ago.
Yeah.
I think I saw an email throughout about that.
Um, yeah.
This is the first reason for, yeah.
My, my question is, is, uh, I've been told the part time backorder.
Um, yeah.
And, of course, once it's done backorder, you know, this, any day you get me, uh, you know,
a, a best folks, you know what I mean?
But what is that kind of approximate, okay.
It's really hard to say because it gets just the proof that we've got a lot, the kind of other customers who have bought these
age opens months ago.
That'll probably be first on the list.
Um, if you've missed something that you really need a lot of vehicle from this, you try to put you up ahead as much as we can, but it's so hard to say.
because they get out of the edge and it just depends when they come down.
Yeah.
It's, it's not anything that's like, I, I, I need to install the rate away.
The big thing is, isn't it?
Before, you know, I've got those cold temperatures in November.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
No.
Like, these things like a pretty strong map.
Like for the most part, most people weren't even plugging in, but I know you want extra insurance for the block users, but
like we own one.
We've never made it for the last, like, seven years.
Never had to plug it in while it was parking out from the streets and we live in our condo.
Like, it's too much.
You're supposed to be driving them daily.
It's only if you're like not going to be driving them for like a week or two at a time.
That's when you kind of have to worry about the battery.
Um, yeah.
And now that they have to block your out, like, I don't think seeing problem in the next few months here.
But that's the kind of the situation I'm in because I work road construction.
Okay.
Once the cold 10 sit and pretty much home, because, uh, they, they don't, uh,
they can't play ash walls in the cold.
Great.
So, um, so, but basically I drive once every two weeks to go get your six-left liquid.
Oh, I know.
So you would end up using it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So the block here is one of the things that are important to me that I do have it before the,
uh, the winter.
I've all done.
I'm going to have someone follow up with you to see me that you went to check out a six-five.
I just wrote a couple of clients waiting here.
Uh, yeah.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Sure.
Perfect.
A lesson we're just going to encourage and we can see what we need to help you out with a six-five and block here.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
No more six-stock.
Bye.
