know. My name is Michael. Hello. What's the name?
My name is Camari. Camari. Hi, welcome.
Marie. Can you help me? I have some questions. Can you help me?
Okay. So I am I'm interested in study, study by Corolla
and hybrid. Do you I see in your website you have a few in
software? So we do have some options available. Are you free to
us about by to review your options today? I know. I want to
finish basic stuff. Yeah, basic.
Is it for again for me?
Do you have any 20, 25 Corolla hybrid, are we available?
Correct. Yes.
And then I just look at I look at the website. I'm in part of my
company there right now. You have. You have the one with the
private 25, 2014, right?
Let me take a look for you specifically. Yes, yeah. Yes, 2020
is the private. Yes, I see things that this is the one is the
price and it's a the price and then we get at the door. Everything
is correct. So our pricing, we do make sure to give our
customers the most aggressive pricing. You know, I do
understand pricing is important to you. So the best deals they do
happen in person. So what I can do for you is I can set up a VIP
appointment to give you the absolute best deal.
So this is the like is it an in person. I'm I live in the
California. I just allow from you.
Right. Yeah. So yeah, yeah, I know that must be what we
follow becomes for the I want to make sure you're in the
same thing here. So the main that's 25,000, 20,
21, 400, it's a black color, right? And the next one.
The black one, no one is available.
You do you do you do you have the same price for different
color. The one I'm looking for is a light. That's a
little, I think I don't know left cap cone is something
way. I see you know, what's beside the side.
What's over what are the colors were you open to?
Yeah, I'm open for first of all, and I'm going to open for the
color is select type. See, let's see,
E, L, E, F, T I, T, E, that's the color. Yes. And then
the the order as well is a that right. And you know, see
where that right, you know, a cap cone is something.
So do you have those in stop?
So I also I've got one that's called the classic silver I
have one in stock as well. And that's why I work with about
20 plus different locations. So all I need is for you to stop
by today so we can you know, get you a color that you would
like.
Hey, hey, somebody in person.
I don't know.
It's a I know it's I get to I know that inventory is limited
right now. But the best part about that we do have some options
available for you to choose from.
Okay.
Okay. And then I saw, okay, so we had this meeting and
I talked to you about that. Okay. So
I was asked if it was an important here. If it
made by the end of the year, the plugway out out there now,
I look involved in a few more months, those by October, November,
December timeframe. Will you have any for most and discount?
If so, what is the end of that?
I don't foresee that because right now, we're actually
about to be hit with Paris. So the pricing as you probably
already know, the a lot of our Corolla hybrids, they're
actually built in Japan. So they're the over here. So you're
actually going to be looking at higher pricing by the end of
the year. So right now, the best time to buy.
Oh, oh, I'm the same. It's a little like target, right? Okay.
Right.
I understand that. So do things and the end of the year could be
more, not last, right?
Yes, correct. Yes.
Okay. And then so another thing is here, when I decide to buy,
if I pay off, you know, no financing is anything
discovered.
You know, if there's anything that's available, only I'll make
sure that you're able to take advantage of it.
Oh, so you don't know yet until that time, right?
Right. Right. I'm as of right now, I'm unsure of that. But as if
it is available for you, I'll make sure that you can take
advantage of it. So put you in the best position to save, you
know, time and money. And that's important to you, right?
Yeah. All right.
I'm also one another question here. I have this, do you accept
credit in car, right? I hear the old car. I want to treat you.
You accept that one, right?
Yes, sir.
We've got trade ins. What kind of vehicle you look in the
trade in?
Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm, this is a good car. I still do get
with the, I wonder my new one. So this I have a 2004
from the CSE.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
20 grand. 2004 Honda CSE.
Good practice and still arriving here.
You said it.
I think for EX, EX, EX.
EX, he is an elephant.
Yeah. Yeah.
Elephant.
Perfect. Okay. How many miles was this when I have on it?
One 100 42 hasn't went.
All right.
And I guess I would think that I would need is to give it a, a
complete appraisal.
But we'll, of course, we'll take care of all that. And then I'll
lay out your options and allow you to choose what works best.
Okay.
Yes.

When we come down on the way to wonder what time my time here.
Anyway, so I get your phone number and then I can call you directly.
