Transcript:
Thanks Paul.
I'm calling out another amount of pleasant.
This is mission sales to the pleasure speaking with.
Chad Hudson.
Hey, Chad.
Hi, I had a call from Brad.
Belair.
Trying to get with him.
Yeah, let me see.
Here.
No, he's with the customer right now, but we'll see if I can help out here.
I'm going to go to the customer.
I'm going to go to the customer.
So you missed the call with them or?
I saw you send me a letter.
I want my Chevy Malibu.
Oh, gotcha.
Is it something that you're looking to sell or trade in?
I don't know.
I'm just kind of curious.
I don't know.
I've never seen a letter like this, or the one in my car.
And my son's kind of wanting a truck, but he's also only 18 years old.
So I don't know.
How is he going to prevent?
Gotcha.
I mean, it's like on that, would you trade it in for your son's truck?
Well, it's famous.
Got to say pretty much the same.
I know it's right.
It's kind of crazy.
So.
I don't know.
I don't know what is happening for the Malibu.
Oh, I just don't know.
I just told him to kind of inquire.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dean, would you begin like a new truck or do you think something for you?
Yeah.
I think it's for you own care.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Actually, yeah.
You've got to see more about the.
You've played knows about.
I don't know what the.
I don't know.
I don't know what we've played for famous two, two, 50 maybe.
Yeah.
I don't even know.
The Malibu is right now.
I mean, since they stopped making them, we've got quite a few customers are looking for those.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's why.
Why Brad's trying to acquire.
About certain five vehicles right now.
So glad you got to get the letter for sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
I don't know anything.
You get 250 payment on those free own.
I mean, what?
You know.
So that's I don't think you get a stupid thing.
I'm pretty sure.
I'm not just a 19.
But.
I mean, that's something that we're definitely definitely interested in.
We're just shy of our 75 vehicle unit.
Yeah.
As far as as far as acquiring them locally.
Because the alternative would be to go to the auction.
I just don't want to talk.
That's where I got a production to be honest with you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This made a good car.
Somebody stole a fucking jack cap.
Like two or three days ago.
I don't know.
So it's just a life on for that.
What is the weather and effort?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The world's crazy.
People still the weirdest.
Yeah.
As fricking crazy.
Somebody stole my truck on my driveway.
I went out that night before an up the keys in there.
I look up.
Nice money.
I waited just as long as I could.
That's my wife.
Where's my truck?
Oh, my gosh.
You don't see all.
You go.
You see.
But yeah.
I mean, I definitely definitely would try and give it a shot.
Chad does try and equal the payments out.
But yeah, I mean, you're right.
It would be kind.
It would be difficult.
But I would try anything.
Yeah.
But at least.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't know what he's.
I mean, I expect why I want to talk to him.
I didn't know what he paid.
Pay that off.
I don't even know what he still don't.
Oh, I want it.
We can get that information for sure.
But maybe he's got access to that.
I don't know.
I'm sure he does.
Did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We got it.
Yeah.
You buy it from here.
No, we got it from a billion.
Okay.
So yeah, you probably.
Probably wouldn't have access to.
I wouldn't go on it or anything like that.
But.
Yeah.
So.
Yeah.
We we partnered up with our marketing team and they kind of.
They got.
We gave them a list of the upload that we're gaining right now.
And then.
We were able to get that back over to Brad.
And then shot it off that way.
But direct access.
We don't have.
Like.
Plus you purchase it.
Here at this building.
But.
Yeah.
I mean, the.
The DMV and I guess the little courthouse will.
Come on.
I'll have a deal.
I probably got a bill around her somewhere.
I can look up and see that.
I can't remember how much we put down.
there.
I think we'd say 16 for.
A couple years ago.
So.
I don't.
Yeah.
But.
Yeah.
I've seen it.
I've seen it both ways.
People going down the car and they.
They owed quite a bit on it.
And.
But.
I mean.
We've been closer on it.
Just because if we don't have to go to the auction right now.
Right.
Now.
I'd rather pay that to somebody with a local title on a base of the inter off.
Sure.
I could usually deal with shit.
I'm gonna you, you know, pay an arm in the leg for stuff.
But then.
Yeah.
I know that option.
Yeah.
I have to say, I just don't want.
I know you guys got to make money.
You have to.
I just don't hear a screw on the job.
No.
Absolutely.
No.
I told you to.
Yeah.
I'll just.
I.
Tell you what.
Chad.
if you can get me something with the bin of the miles on it.
Is this your telephone?
Yeah.
Okay.
You just let it a little bit ago.
I got you.
I got you.
I'll text in my information.
And then as soon as you get over in front of it,
I can kind of get you a ballpark on that.
Now it's not gonna be dead accurate.
What we've been doing, full transparency is KDB.
value, trading value, and then over that.
Just because there's a lot of speeds at the auction,
I'd rather just pay it out.
Yeah.
Like I said, I don't even do it like care if we do it.
They're not.
I was just, I don't know.
I'll just be quiet and see what we got.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But yeah, I'll text over my information here shortly.
And then whenever you get the bin of the miles,
I can at least get you kind of like a rough appraisal
or whatever.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll just get it.
Right.
Okay.
Well, I'm sorry.
Okay.
How are you going to be there tonight?
Oh, until at least seven.

Yeah.
So my, my direct line is.
