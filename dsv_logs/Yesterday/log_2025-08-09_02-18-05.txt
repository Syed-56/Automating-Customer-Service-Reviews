Thank you for calling Jermaine Lexus of Dublin for service and policy for sales and finance press 2 for car wash hours
For new cars for pre-owned
Jermaine Lexus another new car sales
Who might speak with?
This is a new car sales department
Oh, I just look at per day. That's okay. My name is Eric
New car sales. Yeah, my name is Eric. I'm just traveling with my wife. We're starting to look at, we currently drive a GX-460, but it's an old one
And we're looking for it to possibly getting a new LX 600
Okay, yeah, absolutely. I apologize. Yeah, my name is Clay
There we go. Okay, that was all of that. Can you speak with me?
Yeah, no, I'm just a mister
That's all good. I'm Eric. And so yeah, we're just starting the process of looking for new car for my wife
She's on speaker form with me here. So she just handed me the phone to get it started
But yeah, we're just looking we had some friends that had an LX 600, a 2025 up here
And we liked it. So we're just gonna start the process of looking for one of those
And one of the seeds what you had or what the process is to get a 26 or maybe even consider a 25 or even a demo 25 or something like that, you know
But I can tell you she wants like a dark gray or like I guess you call it like manganese or something like that online. Yeah, and yeah, that's what she's looking for
So okay, yeah, absolutely. So at the moment
Do you want to know what we have as far as inventory goes?
Yeah, that would be great. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So at the moment we have two incoming analogation. We have two LX 600s
We've got a couple of LX 700s as well, but in regards to the...
It's a hybrid. It's a hybrid. It's a hybrid. Yeah. Yeah.
Is that the green? Yeah. Let me tell you exactly what it is here. Let me get a lot back into the system here
See if they're coming out with the 26s
Now everything that we have is incoming. Nothing is here on the lot. A lot of our inventory gets purchased before it arrives
I know I know neither of our LX 600s are that manganese luster, but that this is not really too relevant to what we can get you
We can typically get you what you want whenever you're ready, but yeah, incoming we have
They're both 25s the LX 600s and so are the LX 700s. So everything's still 2025 at the moment. Okay.
So yeah, and then now the like I said, neither of the 600s that we have incoming. We have one premium and one luxury.
What's the difference between those? Can you explain the difference between a premium and a luxury?
Yeah, your luxury they offer the appearance package which gives you the black outside mirrors
Not gray grille. I'm trying to think off the top. I had the black door handles.
So it's just like a different appearance there and then depending on
on the one. Let me see if this one has is some of them will have the entertainment system. Let me see if this one.
Yeah, we really don't need an entertainment system. We're past the plan of kids playing games that are okay.
So yeah, I don't need any of that. So it could be just being arrested in the premium is what I would be casting.
Okay, one of those then coming, but the color doesn't matter what you were wanting. So what we would do and we actually
got 80% of our new car deals are done via dealer trade. So in that case, if you were wanting something sooner than later, then we would locate it for you.
Got it. And then be able to get in the bill. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yes, sir.
Okay, we're not in a huge hurry. And so we're really what we're looking at is that that magazine.
I think we'd like the like a saddle tan interior or we prefer to not be black. But, you know, if for the right deal would I consider a black one like a demo or something like that.
It sounds like you don't have any of those or somebody with the traces in because they didn't like it or whatever. I would consider that I think.
But for the right price, but I mean for the most part, yeah, that's kind of what we're looking for.
Yeah, absolutely. So it was just how much extra. By the way, what would the price be for a 25 premium?
The MSRP on the 25 premium before tax is going to be around 115,000.
115. Okay. And what about the, what is the, I like 700. I mean, what does that get here besides where it's hybrid, right? So electric gas.
Yes, sir. Yeah, those are going to run around about 22.
122. Okay. And all that does get to better gas mileage and in the hybrid portion. Okay. Yes, sir.
Okay. What do you want? I mean, we're right sitting here.
I don't know if you have one in that I could come down and just take a look at it.
Yeah. So, you know, so with a model like this, the, as I alluded to earlier, because a lot of our inventory is getting reserve before to rise.
The reality to be able to acquire a vehicle like this, or rather for you to be able to lay eyes on it is for us to work at deal side and seeing.
You know, and make that purchase that way. We, we have a, here's the question, let's say I give you a 500 bucks for a deposit and we get down and test drive this car. We go, don't like it.
Yeah. Yeah. No, no, it's refundable. Yeah. And then also what we, yeah.
And what we could do also because we have, again, we have these two Alexis incoming.
If you would feel more comfortable, test driving it before you decide to make, you know, put pen the paper.
That's completely understandable. We do have these two coming in sometime between the middle of August for the end of August.
I'm more than happy to, to keep you in the loop. When one of these arrives that way, you can stop in when it's convenient for you to test drive and make sure the shoe fits and then we can go from there.
Question up one last question.
The light really life in the system. Maybe this is crazy. Well, stupid, but you've seen a picture of one that was mass black and it may have gotten wrapped.
with you that have any idea where we could do that. I mean, I wouldn't say the color wouldn't matter at that point.
But if we were to wrap it, if you ever heard anybody doing this, I got to know anything about it.
Yeah. But yeah, I've had two customers wrap their GX. So what I would do is I would probably reach out to one of those customers and just say, hey, you know, I got a client here considering wrap it.
How much was it? Exactly. Yeah. So I'd be happy to do that for you if we got down to that.
Interesting. Okay. Yeah. I've never heard of that, but I've heard of it being done, but if you don't offer that paint color, right?
Lexus doesn't offer that. Right. They don't. Yeah. And from, from my understanding, what a customer told me that was advised to them by the company that wrapped it.
Black is going to be your best color to wrap a car. I'll get a black in color and wrap it in the matte black. That would make sense. Yeah.
It doesn't. Well, it really doesn't matter what color you wrap it in. Again, this is just the one example that the professional told the customer and the customer told because she originally was looking for white.
She thought that white was the easiest one to wrap. But when she told that to whatever company or whoever they had recommended to her, the best color to be able to wrap.
The, you know, for it to look to clean, this is going to be black. Got it. Okay. That makes sense because yeah, yeah, it does make sense because it's going to be a black in color over black.
Well, cool. Thanks for your time. And your name again was my name is Clay Armstrong. Yes, sir.
Well, I think when we're down in, when we're down in Columbus, we come down there quite a bit. My daughter's in pharmacist, we'll let her out.
And we'll stop down there sometimes and meet you and see what you got going and chat with you in person.
How about I give you my phone number. Is that cool? Yes. Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
