Thank you for going around at health and speaking.
Hi, I was hoping just to get the fee if I can get a Honda CRV-E XL price out the door.
Awesome. Who do I have to put your speaker on?
Vicki. Vicki, nice to meet you. I'm Hudson. We'll bring you in the market for CRV-E XL.
What is deciding between that and a sportage for an aheu-v?
Okay. I will say that's an apple too in orange.
You had to pick up if the price did not matter which one would you take?
I like the sportage better. And I know it's cheaper.
Yes, we've had Honda's.
Okay. Okay.
What do you want to stick with the Honda family?
But sounds like you like the sportage better.
Maybe.
Is there any reason why you haven't purchased one of your aesthetic curiosity?
Just deciding between the two if the price got anywhere close, I've just had Honda's.
So maybe I do that, but if the price is a huge difference, then it's right.
You're not wearing a pay-can dress more or for a to be a Honda.
We're in our surprise.
So, props. Okay.
Not too familiar with Arizona, but I hear some snow bambir and I'm surprised about there.
Oh. Yeah, we go out there a lot because my kid plays tennis out there.
Okay. And your will be out in e-value the pay-can for tennis.
A little warm probably. Like, her tennis place is like 48.
Yeah. And you wanted to get it going out there for tennis.
Yeah.
Okay.
So we're just calling around.
See who can give us a decent price and then probably just going to pick.
Okay. So I can assure you that all always win your business because we're right Honda.
We're actually the number one Honda dealership.
So if you did have another quote, you were bringing it to me.
I'm sure I can beat it here for you now.
As far as that goes, have you ever driven a CRV?
Yeah. My mother-in-law has one.
Okay. What year is this hers?
I'm a measure.
Okay. You know if it's a new button?
Yeah. My dad also has a pilot.
So.
Oh, sweet.
You're a little more unique.
Yeah. I need to them.
Oh, because kids looks so much better.
They're way cheaper.
So.
Yeah. Yeah.
I might get it.
I mean, a few thousand more, but I don't want to spend like,
I don't know.
Like to be honest, we got a CRV core at 38.
Okay.
That was like one.
That was a good deal.
Yeah.
Okay. Well, if I could beat that.
I would like one.
Would you want to comment tonight and pick it up?
Yeah.
What kind of y'all close?
We close at nine.
At nine.
I'd have to see it make sure my other kid can get my other kid from tennis.
Otherwise, we were thinking about just going tomorrow to get a car.
Okay.
They can use it on super cool.
And it sounds like you got to work out some tennis practice issues,
but other than that, we got some dealer cash this weekend.
And we're having a slow day so far and being the number one how to do it.
I mean, if they want to tell us a price, then I think we can probably just,
I just don't want to come down without a price because we've bought enough cars.
And just like, I'm just going to call around and stay with it.
And then if they give it a deal, then we'll just go pick it up.
Because if our deal is the whole deal.
Yeah.
In the West Valley.
So it's close.
So I was like, well, sometimes this, I was like, I wonder if the East Valley's bigger and does more.
So maybe they're not good.
So I figured I'd just call a few since I'm just sitting here waiting for a kid anyway.
Okay.
Well, why don't we figure this out now.
Do you mind spelling your first and not informing?
Victoria.
Do you guys, UTO or IA.

You want the key.
You're also considering HRV.
How about this?
I'm going to see.
I'm going to see.
I'm going to see.
I'm going to see.

If I could beat that quote, would you want to.
Would you be able to come in this evening?
Probably.
Ryan can get Kylie if they beat it.
Probably.
It's all the way in Scottsdale.
They close at nine.
Yeah.
We close at nine this evening.
Yeah.
I think we can make it.
Okay.
Yeah.
I think we could.
I mean, it takes us a little while to drive so 10.
Yeah.
Well, get back so.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have to Google you.
Hold on.
I have to look on an apple then.
Right.
I'm good.
It says it's 45 minutes away.
Could you come right now?
Um, if they give us a number then probably.
My God, I want to drive without a number.
I'm just.
Yeah.
No, I'm going to show you that.
You might do that.
Oh.
Hold on.
Did you get my text?
Okay.
Um, I did just get a text.
So I'm guessing it's you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then do you have a grant?
You're right.
Great.
You're a great.
Probably.
Yeah.
I'm sure I do.
I think the dark and blue.
Okay.
I mean, we don't need it.
Bye today.
But I mean, if it's there.
Right.
Yeah.
If you could just send me over to.
Yeah.
I don't like to over promise on deliver, but we are the number one on the dealership.
So far as it comes, if you're you have a boat, I'm sure you'll be.
Let me see if they've incentive to me.
Dr.
On the phone.
I don't know.
I just told him I call back.
I don't think he texted me to actually quote.
Let me see.
Sorry.
I'm a relative to many like blind mothers in here.
I need to put names on things.
I talked to them like a couple days ago for them.
I can't forget.
I'm in over.
So it's said we'd come in this weekend.
Oh, yeah.
I'll get out.
I'll get out.
I'll get out.
I'll get out.
I should just five area code.
I'm like, no way.
Who's out here?
I know.
More world.
What?
Yeah.
I just want to come out here.
I don't know.
I have them played baseball.
Oh, OK.
Yeah.
So we were out here already.
What team?
For the Royal Minor League system.
Royals.
I'm actually not the big one.
Even then the quote.
They just sent.
Oh, you know, yes.
They're here in surprise.
So.
Okay.
But he just sent his name and his boss's name.
They didn't send.
The number's over.
It said, come on down whenever.
I said, it's no problem over the weekend.
Cause.
We cannot make it.
We're.
Between work and stuff.
So.
Yeah.
And there's a new.
Yeah.
Is it an original?
Yeah.
Is it one of.
Send us a number.
Are they still open?
Yeah.
I'm not sure what dealership you were working with.
But.
We were planning on just going in the morning.
That's why I was calling right now around.
Um.
Cause I talked to them the other day and just said, we'd probably come over the weekend.
They are.
They're open to on the list.
That's.
That's advertised one.
They close at nine.
They close at nine.
I'm pulling up advertised one.
Instead of the one I'm trying to.
I guess some people put a sponsor to be high.
Like they'll have to pop up no matter what I do.
Yeah.
Well, that is what it's called.
That's.
And if you can get a close.
Yeah, they close at nine.
Okay.
I don't want to just think you go back and forth.
You know, I don't want to make.
Make the process more than one needs to be.
Yeah, I don't want to do that either.
I'm sure I could beat it.
I'll bring up to my boss.
I'm not going to make you guys drive down here if I can.
Now that's just not something I live by or this dealership.
We have a reputation to maintain.
And you guys are all all the way on surprise.
So, you know, I'm not going to make you drive.
Yeah, that's what they're going to say.
I probably won't call him.
Right now.
I don't know.
If you want to beat it, yeah.
It was 38,000.
Yeah.
How are you guys playing on Penn for the vehicle?
Yeah.
We could pay cash or finance it would ever get the best deal.
Okay, sweet.
And as far as I go, could you be here by 815?
Absolutely.
Yeah.
I mean, depending on how long we get back to it, because it takes us like 45 minutes to drive.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
So as long as I could beat that 38 out the door for you, you guys are basically ready to buy
and drive right now.
Are you ready to buy and drive right now?
You have to move any money.
As far as like payment goes and why don't you paying cash or financing.
We could just do a backup.
So you guys could take the vehicle this evening and wire us the money or whatever you need.
Yeah.
I'm going to go by three.
I'm going to go ask my boss to see if we can beat that.
I don't have a quote from you now.
So it's a little different.
But it shows if I could get the green light.
Are you guys ready to drive down here and pick up this car?
Yeah.
Awesome.
Okay.
Sweet.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll give you a poll.
Thank you.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
