Okay, I'll know you. This is how it's in. How can I have a circle?
I'm so very little.
Oh, I'm looking for your young people. Law is particularly, I talked to you again.
Okay.
Now.
Do me, do me, do me.
Do me, do you need me?
Do it.
Do you need me.
Do you need me?
So give me a collection of Mos SPX.
Okay.
I know.
I know.
Hey, this is not what we're talking about.
Are we?
Yeah, I'm speaking with.
So, I'm telling them.
I'm doing good. I just wanted to see if we had anything else to over-end this for some
down the morals. I'm not seeing anything new. You see that lot deals work must go to on the
website. Oh yeah. What are you looking for? What kind of bike are you coming to see?
I'm coming on with just a couple of them. Particularly the 18-hardy road-side ulcer. The
59-3-2-vars. Yes, there's some of the promotions we have. We do have, let me pull it up here.
Oh wow. Okay, I didn't know this. This message just started this one. Pre-owned summer sale.
Okay, so there's this towning all the youth in Venturi and then it looks like her new bike
for doing 0% APR right now on new hardy models, our eligible for it, which is crazy. So we have that
one. So that's going to affect new and used. And then we also have 5.99% APR on select touring models.
So I can do her once. Well I'm going to train in my 2017 all sorts of road-side special
and then write through a check for the difference. Oh, we're going to be financing it up.
Okay, so these are two other questions. Is there anybody that I should see tomorrow?
In particular, when you get here, what's your first and last name? Roy Tellman, T.E.L.L. and
LNA. Oh, I remember you from last week Roy. Okay. You gave me the appointment. I'm like,
I'll be down this for that. It's a little harder. Yeah. No, honestly, when you get here tomorrow,
everyone who's here is pretty experienced. I really like, you know, he's someone that
people for shopping. You know, they're familiar with a lot of people here. But like I said, anyone
that you get would be, you know, pretty well experienced. I just put it in as your first and last
names. But when you get here, you would just check in with that and then they'll have someone
ready to work with you. Whatever time. Okay. Because I did know, I mean, I've never worked
retail hotel sales, but this is my licensure. So I appreciate people who know what they're doing.
But I don't do with somebody in particular to say, okay, you know, this guy can go, you sell,
you know, or, you know, I don't know. Hey, you, right? Yeah, I just do that.
I name that recommended. I just recommend them because I know that they're super familiar with
the inventory, especially Steve. Um, you know, they've got pretty good, uh, because they've been in the
game for a while. So not only do they know the bikes, but they're pretty aware of like everything
that's in the store. I have to current. Because if I come down here, it's gonna be real
for right with riding mine back home or not. But I just want to make sure that anything that
if we don't come here to dream with all my trading, then there won't be a sale. That's the
problem. Okay, totally. And honestly, with you working at cash deal to if you're planning on it,
let's not finance. I know that's back to that into the deal as well. Um, so hopefully we can,
you know, get you the most we can possibly get through that trade in. Sure. Uh,
tell me about the total in here while I get you for a second. Knowledge is going to be lunch.
If it's 2013, the blue also, uh, six, seven, eight, five, three, eight. It says quick for price.
Okay, different reasons for, I mean, I like the old fish. I don't have a choke right now,
but I currently have a blue one, the 2017 I got the dispersal of the blue one. Plus, I've got my,
I had a 2011 road king. So I've got a club in grade dirt, recover that'll fit on the 13,
because it was going over it. So if I can't get the 18,
if you're the one you've got to get for that 13, old for five.
So this one, they have, um, I'm not sure if we have it because it's on our inventory sheet with a
price. So usually when something sold, it's taken off of the sheet. Um, again, this could be delayed
just a little bit. So, but I have a price for it. They have about one at, um, 13, five. But I've
raised that number with a grain of salt too, because like I said, when I was reading the promo
series, that one that I was reading about all used just kind of, that's the first guarantee in that one.
So for all I know, it could be even lower than what I just told you. But that's the
helpful inventory sheet. Yeah. Perfect. Well, hey, can you confirm that it will be there to
again tomorrow? If it doesn't sell today, I get the answer, it's always subject to sale, but
it's been under for a week. Exactly. Okay. Yeah. Let me see how I want to take away that.
Okay. Thanks for having me tight here. Are you still with me? Sure. Oh, yeah.
Okay. So I just don't have, but there's not enough people here for me to get hands on the bike. But I
want to say that we do have it. Because like I said, it's especially in my inventory with a price.
Okay. That's that's cool. I'm because when I thought to go, they know, you said that you had more
in there than what was on the website. So I'm trusting you. Not that you got
some good. I really just did it one or that's an interesting bolt of road. But if you got something else
that's comparable, then, you know, we'll make something happen tomorrow. Of course, of course,
hey, I'm just curious to know this is totally unrelated, but are you planning on entering that
arm wrestling competition? Hell no, I'm 67 years old. Is there an 8 category? Can I get an all
miracle? Oh, women my age. I'm sure I'm even syndicated. It's 2025. But I don't want to
hurt myself to lose. Yeah, I know they're doing like a way in. So I'm sure they'll have some sort of
division. Yeah. I don't know how they're doing it though. This is this will be my first time seeing it
too. Okay. So you might be there tomorrow? Yeah. No, I'll be here tomorrow. I'm virtually just on
a computer, but I've got a good view of what's going on. I didn't know if you could sell it to me
or not, but okay. No, your could be. You could go great. Yes. Yeah, but no, it's okay. For me, I'm just
like the appointment guy, internet, internet guy. So I reach out to all the internet stuff and
that's why I mentioned, you know, when you check in, yeah, it would be whoever you're working with
there. You also just have a large swag bag on my okay. That's you. Yeah, yeah, they'll definitely
have that for you too. Oh, I know. You could go have some nice and go over to the next few days.
I just woke up. So I will see somebody around one o'clock tomorrow afternoon. All right, sounds good. We'll
be here with three not. All right. All right. All right. Take care, bro. Bye bye.
