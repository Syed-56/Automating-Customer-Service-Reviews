Thank you for coming,
and today I'm going to go to the phone number for you, sir.
Okay. And which media are you inquiring, on sir?
It is. It's red. I can try to go back and look at the auto stock number probably with it on the same one only.
Yeah. Let me see, I got it right here, I got it right. People don't allow me to have two right now in my lot.
Yeah, I see the 2025 Nissan Z-performance, sir.
Yeah. That's right. That has like a black top and red edges.
It does, yeah. Okay. What kind of questions you have from your share on the vehicle?
I'm honestly just trying to, I mean, it's pretty straightforward. I mean, I've had the Z in the past.
I'm kind of an end in the market for a Z. You know, we don't really have a ton here locally.
I'm in New Orleans. Okay. They just, they just, they just, simply don't really like,
if a dealership actually even has one, it's typically a black one and I don't want black because it's so hot.
Yeah. So I was actually looking at the red or the blue. Those were two colors that I kind of liked.
But it came across this one kind of long story short. I was shopping, I was looking at Fred Haas, Nissan and Sterling.
I forget Sterling something in Houston. Is there technically close? They're technically closer to me.
Yes, but I kind of expanded my search a little bit because I bought from Vandergrip before,
which is a think out there in Dallas, in the Dallas area. And I just kind of wanted to see what y'all could,
I mean, what's the best y'all could do on it? I don't have a trade. So it just be, you know, financing it.
Obviously, I don't know what the best race are right now for for 60 months.
But y'all, you know, can get or if Nissan has special financing or whatnot.
I mean, I've got to be very credit for what I'm really concerned about.
I'm not getting approved. I just honestly want to find one.
Have somebody drop me up there, purchase it. I've already driven one locally here.
So I know I'm getting.
Oh, and then you're out of the back. That's pretty straightforward.
Yeah, I guess.
All right, so for 60 months right now, we had the 2.9 special for the V and 72 months is 3.9.
So I just show you both options if you would like.
And then were you planning to put any money down for?
That was a funny, simple thing.
Okay, finance all the thing. And then what's a good email?
I guess for you, sir.
So being that I'm in New Orleans, it's.
Yes, sir.
And then our tier.
Yeah, who's that? Okay.
And you're just trying to find the best out the broad price pretty much, right?
Pretty much. Yeah, I mean, back to our license out the door.
Um, you know, I've gotten a couple of couple of different prices.
You know, I'm trying to find somebody who's not going to honestly be asked me with addons and be asked that I don't need.
If I'm going to surround a code to call myself, so I don't, you know, I had one dealership that was going to try to try to
be first around a coding and can and I'm going to do all that myself.
I don't, I don't need any.
Gotcha.
Whatever, whatever that would put on it is not sufficient to what I would be putting on it.
Yes.
And would you think that kind of a whole purpose?
Yes, sir.
I will tell you something right now that I do have beer.
I don't know my vehicle, but I will see what my manager will be able to do for you.
Since, you know, you do live in New Orleans and all that.
Typically we just advertise our addons for like people around the DFW area, you know,
and I'll give you, I'll send you my best number.
I'll see you, sir.
And then we can go from there.
Okay.
Okay.
So I'll feel appreciated.
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Kurt.
Bye.
