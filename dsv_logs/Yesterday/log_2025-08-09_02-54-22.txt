Thank you for your shout out to the floor here in McKinney.
This is really speaking, how am I?
I'm looking for possibly a huge Toyota or Toyota wrap for about 19, 2020, for about 75,000
miles.
What kind of inventory do you have to describe?
I'd love to help out with that and who am I seeking with this name?
Advent Burke.
And then pleasure to speak with you again.
My name is Rudy.
I'm going to go ahead and pull up some of our inventory here to check that out.
And if I had something along the lines of 2019 or 2020 that the branders were looking
for, you'd like to come out and see if this season?
No.
Okay.
I'm mainly looking at interest rates, down payments.
It's possibly for my son from college.
And we already have one right now.
And I'm looking for just the same area.
Do you hit with who could you look up your inventory forms?
I'm not looking at it coming tonight.
I'm not looking to come in tomorrow.
Okay.
I'm pulling everything up here into which part of town or you guys want to have that
kind of relevant right now.
Just curious if you're buying a lot of our folks shop for me.
We're in the left.
And just up there in the air myself.
I'll pull it up here.
I appreciate your patience.
I'm looking for the base model.
Okay.
And was there parameters for mileage on those fields as well?
75,000.
All right.
Specific budget.
You're trying to save us that full of as well.
Carving.
That's our specific budget you're trying to save us that full of on those.
It just depends what you guys have in stock.
We're kind of in the void.
And we'll give them to them.
I'm already part of the three cars from you guys before.
Okay.
Great.
So as far as 20, 19, 20, 20 specifically, I do have a couple of those on hand.
Only those per model for what you're looking for.
20 to be 2018, 2021.
Color is not relevant.
The interior.
I'm not looking for leather.
Look for base model.
Mainly looking for mileage.
And certified.
So right now out of that particular gear model range.
That's a 21 XLU, a 53,000 miles.
That one's called for just 125.
Let's see that statistics range.
Got two others that are real similar mileage.
One just about just under 3,000.
And one that's about 4,000 more on the mileage.
That particular one is about 56,925 on the mileage.
And what kind of interest rate?
How interest rates.
That's the least of your worries.
And we have a great,
under network available.
The opposite is opportunities there.
Now ultimately it does always come down to the overall credit involved.
Oh, I said I'm already struggling.
I said I'm already partners to be for probably 60 months, 72 months.
That's where I'm going to be.
I'm not looking for anything about 4.9.
Period.
That's not should be an issue.
And the solutions available to us.
So what about a Toyota, the HANA inventory?
What do you have in that?
The Sienas are real tough to come by.
I will be completely honest even on 3.0.
But let's see if you have anything.
Are you also considering that through your son?
We have that at one point.
Yes.
If you have the move,
our cure removed.
I don't like the poor danger to the warehouse.
But we look at space also.
And I actually don't have a Sienas presently.
They have to find out your left and right.
You wouldn't believe it.
I understand.
They're lighter.
We have a privacy.
We get Toyota.
I will not deal with Honda.
And the can't period.
Because you go inside.
It's hotter.
And you drive your car in.
And it's an open space concept.
But I deal with you guys.
I go in to go into the pro desk.
And it's comfortable.
That is comfortable.
That is comfortable there.
It's not going to be said to what I'm looking for.
And also to get the help of.
We had Toyota.
Toyota Honda for years.
After this experience.
Several years back.
We'll never find other Honda.
It's only a deal with Toyota.
Wow.
Happy.
We've been able to take excellent care of you.
I'm looking for another one.
So do you have anything with a bug?
Well, I'm looking for $75,000 plus.
Because if you've proper maintenance and the certified,
then I'll have to worry about issues.
Yeah.
I don't know if you have any of these certified.
So the ones that we have discussed so far, they would be certified.
I do have an Excel.
We have an Excel.
We have a 20, 20 with 67,000 miles on it.
I'm not looking for an Excel.
Just that's it.
I'm not looking for a lot for an Excel.
No.
Just that.
I'm looking for the standard one.
It's from a hundred college.
I'll be in the other.
I'll be in the other.
The extra.
Can be checked.
Going back and forth to college.
Certainly.
I'm looking for a lot of ability to have the main factor.
Absolutely.
As far as that's pretty much the majority of my pre-owned and that's
the same.
Do you have access to some of the other dealerships when you trade back and forth
with 35,000?
Pre-owned vehicles.
No.
That's a little bit different than a new car.
You car is the.
Absolutely trade back and forth with other folders.
So what's the.
What's the.
What's the path you have with a.
A 2024.
Graph or.
Pay model.
You're talking free on that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's.
Yeah.
That's.
That's.
That's.
That's.
On a.
24.
Right now the lowest.
SD.
That's.
That's.
That's the.
That's the most affordable out of our 2024 street on and forth that.
What about twice by three.
We've got one coming in.
Yes, under that 24.
That has 64,000 miles, 31,2681.
This is a one person, or a football people.
That's 23.
That one is particular.
That's a closer look.
That's a one person owner.
This one was a two owner.
Definitely not looking forward to multiple owners.
Once you get multiple owners, you get discrepancies in issues with a car, the car max.
If checking and maintenance, you just can't trust.
If it's a rental, rental, the rental company is that better issues.
Definitely understanding.
We take in a ton of vehicles, and especially heading into the weekend, there's a real good chance that something can turn out that maybe a little bit closer to your overall criteria.
has any of them that I've discussed with you so far.
I'd like to kind of area that you're looking forward.
Your exact sweet spot is on one.
At least let me know that.
I'll keep on.
I'll keep on.
All my buddies are dealt with mail.
He's mail told me three.
My three long we probably have.
Can be a little fella.
I'll get the neighbor.
That's how we all know about Toyota the beginning.
I get mail still working.
I do every fire or if you go out of the house.
I can definitely verify.
I'll be honest.
I've been here this location a couple of weeks.
Then the industry for several years.
I'm going to know the whole cruise we have about close to 60 sales people.
But I can certainly verify that in this policy.
Certainly get yours back with mail.
I need to talk about trying to get another car to this point.
I look at his tray in either his car.
Hey, see how much he owes on his car.
How that would work.
And because he has a Ford Mustang.
Okay.
I'm looking for something more economical than power.
Absolutely.
I kept keeping a safer position going to school too.
And his secret answer.
Most of it is worth his raise.
Okay.
I'll tell you this.
I'll take it back with you guys again.
This coming week.
I'll talk to this.
This weekend.
We'll hear the house.
And that's the main issue about.
The main we're looking for something 2020 or less.
And it has to be certified.
Okay.
There's one other person.
Dave Smallell.
72 months financing.
And what else?
No more than 4.9.
Okay.
Perfect.
19 or 20 certified.
One owner.
72 months.
4.9% ATRs.
It's hard.
Is there anything that I'm missing as far as criteria there?
I see.
72 months.
Yeah, 75,000 miles.
And you're just wondering, you want to make sure you're on the seats in the 5,000.
Yeah, because you'll.
You'll try to keep it if you do a ride.
You can go 150,000 miles for college.
Oh, absolutely.
Because as long as you do the maintenance of this work,
I deal with a daily over maintenance or service.
And I've had multiple cars for our maintenance plan.
Oh, terrific.
Yeah, I see the first time here.
Let's see.
Okay.
What's your name again?
My name is Ruby.
Everybody knows me.
It's really up here.
If you have their call in.
And of course, I'll also verify whether or not.
No one's around if he is.
I'll have them reach out here.
Otherwise, expect you receive an email and a text from me.
And of course, I look forward to such a base with you as we head into next week.
So I continue working on this with you.
Okay.
Thank you.
If there have been any.
Goodbye.
