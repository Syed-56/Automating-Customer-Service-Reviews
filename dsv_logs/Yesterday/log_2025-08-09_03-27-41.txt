Thanks, it's always hard and I'm going to help you.
Hi, good afternoon.
I'm calling because we currently have a lease that we purchase through Tuscant DMCB-WIC.
Okay.
And I'm waiting on some numbers back from them.
One of which is keeping our current lease and is a 2022 GMC Sierra 2500 HD.
More what lease or purchase options do they have on a new 2025?
Either regular, the same thing that we have now that the not only are for at the not only ultimate.
Is that 2500 right now?
You said?
Right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Just tell them where.
When you're winter last actual payment do on the vehicle.
This month.
This month.
And what is good?
No, that's good.
You haven't made your last payments.
So as far as options have not been developed.
What you have is you have a residual amount you can purchase the vehicle for.
And find that set to keep it.
And it's on your contract.
That's how you would it is.
All right.
So you find that stuff.
Yeah.
And it's all that.
Okay.
If you're going to a real like 60,000.
Well, it's not you.
Oh, that's what you could buy it for.
It's plus one.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
And whatever.
Right.
The bank increase for.
So you can do that option A option B.
Let's see what we've got here.
And you're looking at another ultimate or what we're looking at in 2500.
2500 are right either regular or ultimate.
Okay.
So we have it at the diesel.
Yes.
So you have what years is 22.
22.
We have a 22.
The ultimate change is ultimate to not only ultimate.
There's the not only reserve and there's the not only.
Okay.
So.
Because the ultimate are quite expensive right now.
I've got them.
We've got received.
I've got quite a few.
So I think we have a regular we have a regular demnolly.
And I'm just looking online.
We're just looking at a regular demnolly ultimate.
So that's okay.
We're doing the same two different things.
Regular zalie.
Then ultimate is like the ultimate.
Which has a massage seat on the rest.
So yours is a Denali.
Right.
25.
So then if you want to now have an upgrade called the Denali ultimate.
Yes.
That one.
Okay.
So that's okay.
I've got six of those.
Let's see what you need.
Yes.
You do.
I'm looking at them online.
Okay.
So white, black, gray.
Yep.
Right.
Right.
Right.
I've got black too.
This is the same.
Yeah.
We currently have simple.
We currently have blue.
Yeah.
We currently have the blue, but either white or gray.
Okay.
So I have two white ones.
We're based in this opiate in 95, 794.
We're just counted 11,000 on one.
And on the other one.
We're just going to push this into where you're going to leave.
Well, what are your thoughts?
So we have plenty of vehicles.
This is the first one where we leave because it's my husband.
I don't know if we buy it for our son.
Got it.
So either we're thinking, okay, do we keep one with the one we have now or do we turn it in?
Or do we turn it in and get something?
Yeah.
Well, how many miles is on your decision one?
40.
I just talked about 48,000.
And more than just a three month, three year lease.
Three year lease.
Okay.
So basically, let's show you four over five.
Yeah.
You're over your miles.
So you don't want to turn it in.
Yeah.
You want me to trade it in.
Okay.
Right.
And then with some, yeah, hopefully with some equity, it's either going to trade it in or purchase it.
Right.
Now, if you were going to lease it, you know, I'm not you trying to sell a purchase that you have 62,000 dollar balance.
Right.
That's your right.
That's your decision.
That's your decision purchase.
Yeah.
Now, if you turn it in and turn it in, you're going to pay miles and not have anything beneficial.
So you get two get offs.
You can either buy your out or lease a new one and they're probably going to be right near depending on the term.
You're probably going to get a better dollar amount purchase in years outright and going monthly versus going to a lease on a brand new one.
Because of the fact that I can get your numbers on both if you want it.
But yeah.
Yeah.
Kind of, yeah.
Okay.
So let's start out getting some connected information and what's your first thing.
Panetta.
Panetta.
And your last thing, Vanessa.
Mendoza.
Okay.
My name's Bruce.
Okay.
I'm one of the senior people.
I'm sorry.
That's A or Z.
Z.
Okay.
And what would be the registered address of all, all need that.
Okay.
So let's,
okay.
So here's how we kind of have to go through this motion.
I'm going to figure out an opt-in text.
Okay.
So yes.
Then I need you.
I need you to, do you have access to the registration of the existing truck?
Yes.
Okay.
So I'll need you to just snapshot a picture of your registration.
Then I'm, after you acknowledge, opt-in on the text, I'll need that.
And then I'll need the exact miles that are on our current miles as close as possible.
Okay.
To the mile.
Yeah.
I have that.
Okay.
You have that.
If you forward that to me, then I'm going to forward you these two links to these, well, I'll
get some numbers on these two.
But it's better if we have an in person and we can see everything.
We can get to the generic part of it.
Then I can have you do something online if you're, if we're close and you got to spend
my commitment to this because we're going to be close to where you're wanting to be at.
Then I'll forward you.
A current application link to get qualified to secure those dollars amounts for you.
Okay.
So we're in the beginning of this.
I can do this for you.
But we're going to need you to do a piece, my piece, to get any accurate for you.
Okay.
What's the key to you, then?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So yeah.
All right.
What's the zip code?
92530.
Okay.
All right.
Let's see this one.
I got you on the phone.
Are we on your cell phone right now?
Yeah.
Okay.
So give me a second.
Here you can receive an email and then we can move forward from there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I could say we reached out to you where we purchased them.
Like I told them when we first leave the truck, they were actually the best as far as pricing.
Who was the best?
Who was the best?
Who was the best?
Yeah.
I get it sometimes who has the best is the best.
But it's a matter of catching the right target.
We have the key inventory of 2500.
So the GSN sales manager is really aggressive on our inventory.
And we have the best right target.
So it's a new list.
And this is two here.
Yeah.
So that's what I told them.
I said right on the map.
I said we want to stick with you guys because you guys were the best when we purchased
or at least at three years ago.
I said, but right out the gate looking online, I told them you guys, them.
And you guys that I'm calling hard and hard at the hard and online without haggling, without
nothing.
I said they're cheaper from anywhere from 5000 to 7000 just online.
Right up back.
Right.
I said, but I call them, like I know I already have a beforehand from five to $7,000.
Exactly.
So that's good.
Yep.
I don't know what it does help.
Especially right now.
Okay.
Let me put in this stock number in here.
Give me a second.
Yeah.
So I'm just thinking about this.
Yeah.
This is going to be his truck has payment.
He's like, Mom, just I just want to, not that I can't make the payment.
He's like, $1,300 is a lot of money.
That's what he's saying.
I can say.
Yeah.
So he's paying right now.
I says, he's like, so I can save 400, 500 something.
He's like, you know, because obviously between then and now insurance premiums have
been up and all this crap, right?
Right.
Like if I could say something.
This is for your son.
You're talking for your son?
Yes.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Oh, okay.
If we silver 25, it's going to save an inch here.
Yeah.
Not here.
I'm sure young is with a good daddy.
Yeah.
So that's good.
What's all?
It's going to be financial.
There might have them because he's the one that has been.
My husband has a day for seeing credit.
Perfect.
So we would keep it the same.
Yeah.
Okay.
So right now you should be your CV.
It's X.
Okay.
Okay.
Did you get it?
Yes.
Okay.
So you have a reply.
Oh, you did.
Yeah.
All right.
Yes, you did.
Now what I need you to do is not shut a picture where you're wrong of the registration.
And I'm going to do it with the very, are we going to lease this?
The new one, are we going to purchase?
Whatever.
Whatever, what's ever Gail, do you have anything down besides the old, old, other truck?
No.
No.
No.
Okay.
The reverse zero down.
All right.
Got it.
So yeah, a few before that was the exact miles and what on your contract.
Well, you got it from us.
Did you?
Oh no.
Where?
I'm sorry.
What did you get to your truck now from the one that you have?
From testing GMC.
Okay.
No worries.
So we should be able to look it up and see what your visual amount is on it.
But you have that long yellow contract from the truck.
No, we have the, they gave it to us on a USB.
Oh, that's what.
Okay.
So did they give you a residual?
You should see what that is.
It looked for residual.
And if you can put that in that and text it back to me as well.
So that'll be exactly.
So I just sent you from GMC online.
I was able to purchase your purchase.
Well, yeah.
That's perfect.
Here we go.
Okay.
I mean, that was the other thing.
That's the thing.
Cool.
Look at our mind.
That's my husband's like, take my husband's daddy's like, if we're going to pay a
weight on a used truck, well, let's look at a used truck.
And I'm like, but he, what he has refused all what he would pay is not that.
I'm telling you what the market is right now.
That's right.
You're right.
Obviously, it changes with the price of people.
So that's your purchase that you pay off the amount.
Your own yours is now the only thing that we do to that is that sales tax and whatever.
The final thing about that.
That's why I said no, that really isn't a good price of the truck.
So I'll be sure options on the purchase of that one and it leads on the others.
That's the only way we're going to probably be close to each other.
Okay.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Obviously, I want to say the best bottom price.
Yeah.
I want to save money right now.
He's paying $1,300 a month on a lease.
I know.
So, you know, if we can get under a thousand a month, that would be fabulous.
But I don't know.
Right.
You might be going on the purchase for going into four months.
That's probably the closest you're going to.
That's the closest credit.
Good.
He has a GMC lease, but that's the time every day.
Yeah, that's true.
You're right.
Yeah.
You're pretty.
I think, correct.
Well, you can get the lease originally two years ago, but if you make your payments on time,
it'll still be good.
Okay.
And then you're perfect.
Yeah.
So the same.
Okay.
So, can you forward me the miles and the zinn?
Let's see if it's better.
The vennans on the document.
I just sent you.
Yep.
I got the mop.
Nope.
I got the mop.
Well, yeah, it's just on here for you.
Yep.
Let's go.
So, that is.
Okay.
I got everything I need except for the exact miles or coast.
Yeah.
That's end of year.
Oh, yeah.
Confident.
You're perfect.
Perfect.
Let's see.
Yeah.
Oh, six, seven, seven.
Okay.
Vanessa, let me go to work for you.
I'll make probably back one or two times just for anything else.
Do you have a 15 non-lease at the location as well that's not a GM?
I'm sorry.
Do you have a non-GMS lease at your house?
No.
No.
No.
Do you have a purchase that's non-GMS?
No.
No.
What do we have?
It's got to be read on the table.
Everything we have right now?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everything we have right now is paid for cash.
No, no, no, no.
I'm just saying that only.
That's not a problem.
What I'm asking about is do you have any other vehicles registered that you're address
that are non-GMS?
Yes.
Okay.
I think it's newer than a 2015.
Let me see what I have.
Newer than a 2015.
$10.
2010?
Let me see what I have.
I'm going to the management policy.
We have to make our order.
That's what I'm saying.
And it doesn't have to necessarily be in your husband's name.
It's just registered as that address.
Okay.
What other vehicles do you have?
I'm asking this.
I'm asking this because there are some rebates involved in certain criteria that helps help
better.
We have a 2018 Ford S250.
Perfect.
That's it.
That's it.
Okay.
So if that's part of getting you a better discount rebater.
Otherwise the only thing I would need is a copy of registration when we commence rate the deal.
If we commence rate the deal.
Okay.
No problem.
I have that.
I have a 2015 on that part.
Perfect.
Give me a 10, 15, 20 minutes to get some things together.
And I'll forward to your all fortitude.
Okay.
And then you can decide how to do it like you proceed.
Fair enough.
Okay.
Appreciate the opportunity here.
Thanks, Vanessa.
All right.
I think you should.
No problem.
Okay.
