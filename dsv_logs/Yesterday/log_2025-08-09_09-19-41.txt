Thank you for choosing Center I-4. This is an S-I-Can help you.
Is there a Victor working there?
Victor, you know what?
We used to have a Victor and we also currently have a Vincent.
Is it somebody you purchased with? I can look up your phone.
If you'd like.
Uh...
Uh...
...for...
Okay, let's look at your name as Art.
Yes.
Yeah, that was a Victor, Lozano. He was with us here.
Yeah.
Is there something I can find out for you? Can someone else help you with something?
Yeah, no, I just figured I'd talk to him if he was still there, but no,
yeah, just someone in sales that I could ask regarding a Ford Explorer.
Yeah, definitely. Is there a particular one you saw on our website or...?
No, I just want to know if there's any, um...
...an advertisement as far as leases and purchases.
Yeah, let me check here for you. Let's look here.
I work on the phone, but I think everyone's with a client, but I'll try to see what I can find out.
Okay.
I'm going to have one of the guys get some details here for you. Let's see.
Let's go.
Okay.
Let me close and see if there's any special.
There.
There.
You're looking for like a lease or...
Brian.
Oh, yeah. I want to see what the lease is.
Um, if there is a lease advertisement.
Damn, definitely.
That's the care.
Oh.
Okay.
I apologize. I can Peter's being a little slow today.
No, it's okay. It's not like my brain today.
I know, right? I hear you for sure. Let's see here.
It's been a long week.
Right. I know. I'm ready for the week.
Well, I'm work all weekend, but hey, I'm off landing Tuesday.
You know, I'm going to do the stuff for you.
Yeah, I know. I was just on a quick hold.
I did see one of the sells guides for you.
I won't have somebody, you know, give you all the right details.
Can I put you on a quick hold?
Sure.
Thanks. Everyone will.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, God.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hi.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I'm going to go to the next one.
This is really the round and round.
This is the round and round.
That's the last.
It's a lot of sweet shots.
Hey, this is David, time to make some more.
Yeah, hey, David, this is our order.
Yes, everything out of the price of a Ford Explorer.
Yeah, they actually have 0% advertised right now for the Ford Explorer.
If you finance them for 48 months, that's one of the special that they're running at the moment.
For 48 months, and what's a sticker on it?
It's on whichever one you want.
I mean, it just depends on the trim.
What were you kind of looking for?
White was black trim.
I had a prior for Explorer.
They just had a third row.
A third row.
You remember the line?
Okay, gosh, what was that one there?
Does that have like, let it into your cloth interior on that one?
It has cloths.
Okay.
Well, the newer ones have like, they have some pretty nice features.
It's like a half-weather half-quality cloth.
Let me see.
White with black trimming.
Let me see here.
Let me see what I have available.
Okay.
I do have a couple of them.
Some of the stickers range from 45 to 48 depending on if you want extra packages and stuff.
But it's kind of filled with it looking for.
It just ranges.
So, at 48 months, we could do some math on that.
I'm not going to hold you to.
I'm just trying to get an idea of what the payment will be at 48 months.
Oh, yeah.
So, I think one at 45,000, but it's actually 50 off the door.
Yeah, correct.
Yes, I mean, 48 months, you know, that'd be at 1,000, like 1,040 a month because it'd be 0%.
Oh, what are you doing that?
I can't know if that was it.
That's all good.
Yeah, so, I would have your turn.
I'd be your turn for a longer turn.
That'd be nice.
Well, I didn't expect it to be that high because I wasn't doing the math.
But I'm like, wait a minute.
So, I'm just a math.
What is that going to be?
That grant?
Wow.
Okay.
Yeah, if you do like 50 by 48, that's the payment right there.
Okay.
So, what about on a perc on the lease?
What's your lease right now?
On the lease?
They're running some pretty good programs too.
Let me see.
I mean, a lease would definitely be a lot cheaper.
They do have it three or least.
Let me see if they're running any specific offers on that trim, let's see.
Let's see here.
So, on an explorer, you could do, you could do, you could do,
they do have a lease bill where if you do 36 months with four grand down,
your payment is 430 plus tax.
And tax is, I mean, based on where you live,
that could be anywhere from 30 bucks to 40,
so I'll call it under 500 bucks for sure.
I'm an urban strike grant.
I'm in Beaumont.
Okay, so your tax is probably somewhere on TANAS.
So, that'd probably be 430 plus tax.
You'd probably have like four or 70, it's probably $40 of tax.
No, that's not bad.
But you need four grand down or five grand down?
Oh, 4,400 is being that clear.
All right.
Let me, let's ship here.
You had a four, 150 STX on the billboard for, what was it, 380?
Oh, my car.
Yeah, that one, that STX.
I believe that one is the, if I'm not mistaken,
that was on the SuperCab one.
The one was the half door from the non-mistaken.
Yeah.
That or?
Yes.
Yeah, the SuperCrew door.
Yes.
Yes, that one was five grand,
do I have signing it from the non-mistaken for that least deal.
Five?
Yeah, I think it's five.
But I think the payment was actually low.
I think it's 360 plus tax on that one with five grand down.
That's five grand covers what?
So that's five grand.
It's not really that it covers anything.
It's just when they put those least deal ups,
they usually just put them up with this amount of money
would get you to this payment.
But it actually does cover in it a small portion of it
will cover your first payment that you make and your acquisition fee.
The rest of it is just the down payment that they advertise with this
so that way you can get that, that certain monthly payment.
What fees do we talk about?
Well, the first payment is just, you know,
say your payment's $400.
Your $400 is being covered with your down payment with your do-add finding.
So that pays your first payment and then your acquisition fee is around like 500 bucks or so.
And that's, I mean, that's really it.
So where's the revenue?
So that money go.
If it doesn't go towards the vehicle,
I say when I turn it in, I wanted to buy it.
There's nothing from that 5,000,
go towards that purchase.
Know what that goes to is it just goes towards your payments on the lease
because you have your residual value.
So when you're leasing,
usually the percentages like say it's like just around a number, right?
It's 60%.
So 60% of the car is what you're going to be paying.
And when you put money down on the lease,
you're covering what you're going to be paying over the three years
to make your payments smaller.
And that's an end you have your residual,
which is just with left of the car,
but that number never changes.
So if they have to end the vehicle only over like 20 grand of the truck,
and you're like, okay, I want to buy it now,
then that's what you would owe just with 20 grand.
But the money down that you're putting initially is just to give you a lower monthly payment.
Okay, so at the end of the lease,
what is just out of the blue.
At least what is really left on that?
Hey, I'm not that fearful.
I mean, just roughly, I mean, depending on what the residual percentage is,
say it's 60%.
I mean, you're going to be, if the truck is 50,
I mean, you're going to be somewhere in the mid 20s,
like maybe like 25 on your residual.
And then at the end of that, that's what you would have to pay.
Either if you want to buy it out or finance it,
or even if you want to give it back,
say you have equity, you could always give it back,
and then get your equity.
Like say you have a-
What equity was that fee?
Well, say you keep it under the lease mileage,
and at that time the truck is worth like 27 grand.
Instead of 25, you would get two grand basically for selling your car back to us.
Right, right.
Or you could use that to trade it.
Yeah, exactly.
Or you could use that and trade it in for something else,
and lease something else, and use that equity towards the new lease.
And it would count as a down payment in the sense.
It'd be like, oh, I'm putting two grand down.
You know?
Right.
Okay.
Yeah, because, anyways, all right.
Yeah, I'm just debating right now because I'm looking at a different car.
I'm just trying to see what's going to be the better bank for my buck.
Oh, okay.
Like for me, it'd be the truck.
I'm paying a thousand dollars more down to the floor.
It explores another hundred dollars more.
So there's twelve hundred dollars in one year.
So, okay.
One is this lease or this program going to end.
I believe they're going on to the remainder of this month.
So, I mean, it should be just this month.
And then after that, I'm not understanding.
I would now closer towards the end of the month to see if they're going to do something else.
Okay.
That's what I figured it'd probably be full of month.
Yeah.
All right.
Okay.
What's going on is what are my cars?
They're going to, they're trying to buy it back because I'm having a lot of problems with it.
Okay.
So, until they, until they finalize this, I don't know what they're going to do.
I don't know what the, hey, I'm just going to be making old money.
So, I'm like, you know, I'm not really clear on what you guys are telling me on this.
No.
Until they give me a final number and I look at it.
Well, what's this?
I mean, yeah.
No, yeah.
No, I hit you.
I'm waiting.
I'm waiting to hear back from them and I'm supposed to hear back.
Hopefully, with this next weekend, so I'm trying to really find out what is going on and
what's going to be the term.
So, now I'm just trying to look at the cars to see what I want to get if I just thought
I get something once I feel with them.
Okay.
Well, yeah, I mean, if you want an echo follow up with you next weekend and just kind of see.
And if you're going to answer by then, you know, maybe we could talk a little bit more.
And then, you know, maybe you could even come in and check out the trust and everything too or the explorers and too.
You like better?
Well, I had, I had both.
I had the explorer and I did it just kept it.
I traded it in.
And I regretted it.
But, you know, so it was done and was done and now the scar that I got, because of that, you know what I mean?
So, it was like, so what happened was I had at least on a 150 level truck.
I turned it in.
I was in a walk away.
But, I didn't.
I went and got an explorer.
So, what's supposed to do?
But, you know, I loved the car.
The car was great.
But then I found another car that I fell in love with and I got rid of it.
And so, in some ways, I don't trade it.
Just keep the car.
I did.
And my intuition was right.
No, okay.
But anyways, what's done is done.
So, I had a 150 and I had it before, so I know both of vehicles.
The truck was great.
I mean, I had to pull my Jesse to the river and piece of cake.
I mean, he didn't fill the damn thing.
Almost back there.
But, the floor was a good car.
It was right high.
So, I have trucks.
I just, I'd rather have a car.
But, again, we'll see.
I'm going to see how the car's play out.
Oh, okay.
All right, well, yeah.
Just let me know.
I'll follow up with you too.
We'll keep in contact.
All right.
Yeah, like I said, I'm fully here back from them.
Maybe Monday.
She's full of call me back.
Because they're really approved by back.
So, now I'm just waiting for the final numbers to come back so I can look at them.
All right, yes.
I'm good then.
I sent you a text to your paper.
All right, but that way you have my info if you need to reach out to me.
You could either text me there or I gave you some numbers to call to.
Okay.
All righty.
Sounds good.
It was nice talking to me.
Same here, bro.
We'll talk.
Thank you.
All righty.
Goodbye.
Bye-bye.
