==== NEW TRANSCRIPT ====
Transcript:
Thank you for the Congress.
My co-current.
Yes, we were speaking earlier.
I'm not sure if that was you or somebody else about a car that we were interested in and maybe that we were going to put down the thousand dollars deposit to hold it.
Okay.
Let me thank you for your working with me.
Where you in the store?
I know it was just over the phone.
The person's name, I think, is very good in the East.
We've been working with staff since we're the state of the car.
That brings that.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, let me just answer your name.
I'm not on that.
Okay.
Please, I'll be right.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming here today.
This is Brian from Phil and coming out this year.
Yes, we were looking at a car with separate and apparently
is a flumper induction and we were hoping that it
could be $1,000 deposit down the whole list.
Yes, there is actually less of building today.
We go over here, go over here, we stick it out.
At least $1,000 deposit down the road.
And on that orange.
Yeah, I think it's my own.
All right, can we just a second?
The 2019 deposit back limited with 147,000 miles.
Yeah.
All right.
And then has you assess the turnover and menu for the vehicle
at all?
No.
The pricing menu.
Yeah.
OK, so what we will need to do is we will just
need to get a pricing menu sent over to me just a second here.
And I am going to give me one second.
All right, so we can see here the now.
So it looks like everything should be good here.
Looks like we got the fresh trade here of ours.
So what I can do is if you really
want to place it a pause on this vehicle, I'm assuming,
because I can tell that it's kind of take care of it in the morning
or I can just help you out now, which are we referred.
Well, the concern was that we would lose the cloud
between now and the morning.
OK.
So we'll do an easy guarantee that that one
happened without putting the deposit down.
Unfortunately, no, we would have to do that
for actually confirmed vehicle here.
But I mean, if that's the case, I can take care of this
because the pricing menu is set over here for you
and then kind of take this deposit if you're ready for today.
The situation was we came and we looked at the cloud,
class, weekend, and it hadn't gone through the investing yet.
And it had a few things wrong with it.
So it was going to go through inspection
to see if it had some inspection.
And we just got the call that it did pass.
But we haven't really had a chance to talk from staff
about moving forward and processing the cloud.
We haven't even taken it for a test drive.
OK.
So how, I mean, obviously, we can
project the risk away for the morning.
Obviously, those Saturday is a pretty busy day here.
So I always love people now deposits
and I'm going to wait a really guaranteed
you have to want to be gone for you.
So this is the target of the choice, the person
for the car?
Yes, ma'am.
OK.
And then one other question.
If we purchased the car through cash,
do you guys need a money order or how does that work?
I mean, we can do personal check money order.
Those are typically the two most popular options.
OK.
The question is to get done here on our side.
Whyers could take care of it.
What about a driving car?
We could do that as well.
We typically don't like to go up that high.
But if that's the only form that we have,
we can definitely get up.
OK.
So let's go ahead and put the deposit down on it.
So it's held.
We're pretty sure we want the car.
All right.
So let me just put some brief hold right here
where I've had a figure something out here.
And then I'm going to start getting a work for you.
But give me just a second.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
All right.
Give me an copy right back.
I think I like to run here.
I'm not sure.
I said, oh, wait.
Hold on.
Yeah.
I think that's good.
I don't know.
So I can't be able to wait.
You know?
You know?
I think I got to wait.
So I see.
I can't be able to wait.
OK.
I'll tell you, my head is not ready to go here.
You know?
I don't know.
I don't know.
We're waiting.
I don't know.
So it's a little bit confusing.
Here we are.
Alright, sorry about that weight.
I just had to put you on a little hold here
because I had to get access here to your account so I can go ahead and help you.
So I'm just going to go ahead and get this pricing menu for you.
Send this over and then how do you plan on paying for this vehicle?
Is it going to be cash or is it going to be financing?
No, trust.
Okay, perfect.
So let me just go get this pricing when you take it out and then I will reach right back out to you
and then once we can agree and embrace here, I can go ahead and take a deposit and we can lock this in for you today.
Okay, so you'll pin that to my son.
Yeah, that's what I have here, Mitchell McGary.
Uh huh.
Do you want me to reach out to, oh yeah, this is the same number I have here.
So yeah, I can just give this number call back.
This is like a send that over to you.
Okay, and so I'm assuming the price is negotiable with what this is saying.
I would have to look into it.
I'm not too familiar with vehicle here, but I mean, typically we can always want to do what we can in your business.
And so, all definitely do what we can in there.
I don't usually tell people in a couple of thousands of offices pretty far off, but we're always going to do what we can in the
business.
Okay, and then we have to do all that before we took the deposit down.
Yes, ma'am.
Unfortunately, we still do have to before we took the deposit for you, we would still have to have a sign menu like a green on a price in hand.
But I mean, no worries.
This will take me slower here the end of the day.
So I can now this menu for you in five minutes.
And then it will take a few, you know, ten minutes to figure it all out, and then I can just be taking her deposit.
Okay, my concern is my husband is out of town and he's going to use her with handles and stuff.
I'll try to get a hold of a mail once he's underclaking any.
Yes, ma'am.
So let me just go get that and then we can reconvene and figure out how we can figure this out for you.
Okay, thanks so much.
Of course, I'll leave it.
We'll leave it for a while later.
Bye.
All right, so good.
