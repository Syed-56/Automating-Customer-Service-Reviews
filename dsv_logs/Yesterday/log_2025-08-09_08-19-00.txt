Thank you.
And in front of you.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I'll give you a card in this call from the server.
Perfect.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I'll give you a call.
We have received an employee from your, let me see where it was on.
On a new server out of 1,500, we are two.
So do yourself to see when you would be able to come in and take a look at it.
Well, so, do you want to have, whenever I kind of just went through like,
trade like build menu, that was I guess, one, I guess, popped up that way.
It was closest to match.
So I guess what I was, what I was looking at.
Is that the only, I guess, what do you guys have at your location?
Or like whenever it's populated up, I just kind of looked on that one.
And I didn't actually go through like open inventory.
Do you all have anything else to murder that?
Or does the only one?
Let me look for you.
We have 75s for Verados.
Are you specifically wanting the VRQ trim model?
Not necessarily.
Like the only reason I was looking at the VRQ way, if I was looking at, there's a couple
of factors.
One, I wanted to have the six two in it.
And then the other part of it was basically like it being blacked out.
And then that one looked like it was like one of the better, I guess, off road packages
that you guys had.
I didn't know if y'all had any other trim levels that had.
Like when I was reading on it, it said that you guys found that the VRQ had the walking
front mirror of the grandfels.
Okay.
I was perfect.
I don't know the answer to that question.
I know.
I wish I did.
I don't want to lie you though.
So I really do not know the answer to that.
Let me add.
Okay.
You really fast.
He's right across for me.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
And the, I noticed that it was, I released it seems this way that all the 1500s, at least,
I don't know if that's just what is carried in the floor.
Like on the, on the website, I'd use them go through and change like different things
or whatever it is.
But you don't have any that have filmmakers or they only on your 25 and 3500.
Any that have what?
So you're just kind of seeing your view.
Okay.
Yeah.
Can you hear me?
Okay.
Yeah.
I can hear you turn it off.
I don't know.
Don't know.
Don't know.
Someone gives body service.
No worries.
Oh, that thing might be all have any to have any co-meers on them or are they only on the
25 and very about 100.
Co-meers, like the major but you know.
Like it's, like, yeah, like if you're throwing the vehicles, you have a co-meer instead of a
co-meer.
I don't know that you do on 1500.
I will have to also get back into that.
Look at the windy sticker right now.
It's the, it does have a...
Yeah.
I didn't see it.
It seems that most of the 1500s, not just you guys like, like every brand or don't have
per judging the 1500s and all that.
And I see that they don't come from the factory with co-meers,
so I'm sure the one that's on my gut.
Right.
Specifically.
And sometimes we order weird stuff because we know people like that.
So we'll definitely all look in safety planning with that.
But as of right now, there are other two requirements for the 6Q and the glass gal.
I think we have 3.
For the 6Q leader that are VR2s.
And I think we also have a...
That will be the black gal.
That one doesn't count.
Yeah.
It'll just be for those different travel roles.
Are they, are they, are they, are they, are they okay?
Yeah.
We have a lot of police with almost everything that the wheels aren't blacked out.
And it's probably not going to have the off-road packaging, like that.
I think it's probably, let me look at the stock number for one you can't end.
But I've seen...
What essentially is that one?
Okay.
Well, essentially what I was looking for was a half-fun, full drive blacked out.
And like I prefer the bigger engine.
And I would rather have a gas or a vehicle.
Okay.
Perfect.
We're working to click in around.
I'm going to look on here.
And I might pick you a couple.
I see that you did or form a gas system.
I think you back a text from that system.
Okay.
Like I was going to see it anymore.
But I'll probably send it from a different system.
Where does it still do something?
Ground.
So it'll be through.
Okay.
The other reason I was looking at some of the higher-sum-level two was because I was trying to get like some
gas and ventilation.
Okay.
You want to use it as a big pot?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Trust me.
I'm very glad.
I'm glad.
Is there anything else that you're like, if it doesn't have this, I don't want to look at it?
No.
But pretty much there's a lot of stuff.
I don't know.
You guys call me all.
I know that everybody has a little bit of a name.
I know.
I think the name is called much the night edition.
I think the work that I was like, the black out.
It's been like, okay.
So it's actually pretty much the same thing recycled.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know there is name differently.
Basically, I'm not a handsome.
I never have been.
I would prefer blocked out.
If you have green, that would be like my top color.
And that would be a blacker blue.
Okay.
Well, I've got a green one to show you.
You're not a living innocent at you, but I'm glad you said that because we have one.
It's called cyborgs gray, but it's really just like a C.D. green color.
She's just going to receive two.
It looks like it has to go to the.
Yeah.
Quite true.
As well.
I'll get that one over.
Yeah.
I mean, I'll see.
I mentioned this.
The black one.
The gold drive is important as well.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
I'm sure it's an important.
I believe it's not mistaken that every year or two is going to be four little drives.
Yeah.
The year or two should be.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just the.
The one that you want is just found like as you are to is going to have everything you want.
Because it's going to be four little drive and it's going to be more likely to have the.
The.
You know, because it's not just stuff.
So it's just more likely to have everything you're looking for.
Yeah.
I was actually comparing.
Side by side the silver auto and the.
The GMC's like just because I know they all are both GM or whatever they saw.
You're trying to compare it to and it looks like.
Y'all's packages were different too.
Like all term models were all made different things.
Yes.
Absolutely.
They are.
Front leather.
A pointed ventilated power bucket.
Okay.
Perfect.
So one I just sent you the link.
It does have the latest seat.
A six to an four-wheel drive and blacked out.
And it's green.
I think you're going to like it.
Yeah.
I'll take a look.
Your window sticker on it is 79.
Oh, eight.
The seven year and thousand eighty dollars with all our dealer discounts and should be bonus cash and stuff like that is about.
Six grand under sticker right now.
Okay.
I don't know the thought picture doesn't look like it's really green.
I'm more than happy to run out there and take a photo of it with myself.
And it's been here as well.
He needs to see it.
Okay.
Sorry.
I'm trying to.
For.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I'm not sure.
Well, no, I accidentally.
Um.
I accidentally like when I went to click on it, I somehow ended up swiping over and.
Uh, like, essentially, not the weird, but like, so like a spam folder or something like that.
So I turned the point.
Yeah.
Like our type.
I did.
Yeah.
I found it.
I'm just trying to get it to.
Pull back up.
Yeah.
I just want to look more great in green.
Yeah.
In person, it looks more green.
So, it has to tell us as thinking about pictures.
I'm more than happy to run out there and take a picture of it for you as well.
Okay.
And this one is your cue.
So this one.
You said this one.
The seventy three is the asking version.
You're right now.
Yeah.
seventy three one twenty six with all the dealer discounts and bonus.
Okay.
And that's the key final to Jim Pineapple for at least two thousand other.
I know thirty nine hundred is the dealer discount available to everybody.
But the Jim bonus cash and the other one, the two one thousand dollar ones were going to be through financing through
your team financial.
I believe.
Okay.
And what, what is the normal, I guess interest rate, the dollar going as, like with them.
It's really going to depend on necessarily in normal interest rate.
Okay.
Like, I was curious, like, ran.
I was asking to like, ran how to, how to think.
Where essentially qualified buyers are launching.
You're like, philanthropists, you get like a 1.9.
And I have a.
I have over.
Okay.
I was.
I was.
I was.
I was over eight hundred.
I was.
Over eight hundred.
I know we have it on LPs.
LTVs are a piece.
And it has zero percent for thirty six, two point nine for forty eight and three point nine for sixty.
But I don't.
The New York news.
Maybe.
It's just the.
On my.
The lowest.
The lowest.
Yeah.
I could be.
One of my grades and I could be not seeing them or not banners.
So I'll definitely ask about that.
There are incentivized grades because I believe it's for Dan.
So we can just pop the bin and check it.
Okay.
Yeah.
Go run out there.
It's gonna take for you and get it over to you that we can see if it's like green enough for you.
If you think it looks too gray.
And then we'll move on to the last.
It's up to the case.
Okay.
Perfect.
And then your specialist is Clayton.
So any questions that I can only answer for you with us from this or some more than you think.
I think we will be able to answer for you.
He's a lot more knowledgeable than me.
So if you end up on the phone with him and Clayton.
He knows that he talked about it all.
Like a therapy.
Okay.
All right.
Perfect.
Drop it in any other questions I can get answer for you.
No, that was.
That was the main.
Main thing.
Like I said, like it doesn't have to be.
As you are too.
I was looking.
It looked like that was.
Like I looked at the higher from top to be.
where the ones that had some of the things that I was looking for.
So.
And that one is not in the population whenever I.
Like from the show, you went to site whenever it kind of looked up.
Whatever was close within 150 miles.
That was literally like the only one that popped up.
And so that's why inquired about it.
Well, perfect.
And where are you looking at it?
Is that Porter?
Is that.
I mean, I'm in.
I'm in.
I can have bars up from the binary.
I am.
Cold tissue.
Probably not a half.
Okay.
So not at four hours, which is great.
People don't know.
No.
No.
I mean, you're.
You're close enough that I had friends in high school.
That was good.
And would come home when the weekends.
And so, I got that.
I know.
I have a.
No, I have a.
No, I can't.
No.
No.
Okay.
Awesome.
Well, would you be able to come in like tomorrow or would it probably be next week before you
go to the end?
Honestly, it depends on.
I guess if I find something that I like and then I look from there.
Okay.
Yeah.
Sound like a point I'll run out there and get that picture.
If you think of anything else, you can shoot a text message.
Is a member I take to be from or call me back at the summer.
Okay.
All right.
Perfect.
Thanks.
In.
All right.
All right.
Bye.
All right.
Bye.
