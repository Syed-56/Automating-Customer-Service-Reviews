Can you go to like in this comments? You can have an address you call.
Hey, good afternoon. How are you?
Good, how are you doing, sir?
Hey, I'm doing good.
Actually, I see one now for online, but not from the NC, not from Hendrik.
I see the ID4 release start at $99 per month.
Actually, I'm able to give you any offer like that.
We hope to friends we are ready to take the course.
Absolutely. I hear my friend give me two minutes.
Let me get you over with the other thing.
We'll see how we can help out. Okay?
Okay, sure.
Two seconds before I get you passed over.
What is your first name?
My first name is Rama.
Okay, last name.
Busch-de-la, be it.
You hear your name?
And Tash.
Are you here in Concord?
Yeah.
You're in Concord only.
Fantastic.
Got you with the best you know just for us?
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
And then this is the best call.
That's number four.
Yeah, this is the best call back.
Fantastic.
All right.
Hello, this is Jason with the Hendrix Volkswagen Sales team.
How am I helping you?
Hey, good afternoon.
Happy Friday.
Happy Friday, user.
Appreciate that.
Yeah, thank you.
Actually, myself, my friend looking for the two cars.
Okay.
And while we are browsing, we see the one that, but not from the end, we are the state.
Loader, a bunch will Volkswagen.
They are offering the $84.99 per month, the least for 24 months.
What state did you say you found that?
I'm not sure.
Loader, a bunch will Volkswagen.
Many are pulling something.
Okay, yeah.
So, I mean, different areas have different promotions, but currently I have, I think, like,
three or four ID fours here, and available.
They are pro-west pluses.
So I'd be happy to help you.
What time do they, were you looking to come and take a look at them?
Just so if you're home, that leaves will be.
It's just going to depend.
I know it requires money down, and the ad is exclusive of tax tag and title.
And we do have some dealer accessories on the vehicle as well.
So as long as we put money down, we definitely get to close to the number you're looking
for.
You're trying to be at $99 a month, though?
Yeah.
Home, right?
Yeah.
We need to go and get into it.
Probably, because this is going to be a different trim level than what's advertised
there.
I mean, you're probably going to need to get to that price, probably like 10 grand or more.
Oh, and then no more.
Yes, there.
Because we have the pro-west pluses, which is the highest trim level.
I'm sure the advertised model is a pro.
Okay.
You will throw us, we can wait.
Let's see.
Here is the thing.
I don't want to view the business to the other person where I am not leaving.
Sure.
Yeah.
Oh, I understand.
We appreciate that.
Yeah.
And the hand is very near to my home and the other day, previously my friend saw so there.
If you give the very good deal, my friend and we ready to take, we don't want to pro
plus us.
Pro is also fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Their offering is 2,500 or something down payment and $99 a month.
$20,000.
Yeah.
24 months.
Right.
You give the tougher.
We can come and take two cars.
Yeah.
Just kind of give you some insight.
My role here is a product specialist to know the product.
So the money side of things is not where I felt, but I do know the product and I can help
you.
But I wanted to go over the current offers that are available here.
And that is for lease, it's 209 for 24 months lease.
And that would be $44.99 due at signing.
And that's so exclusive of tax, tag, title, and licensing fees.
I don't know where they're getting the 99 price from, but I would assume that if you were
to go to do that deal, you would need probably quite a bit of money out of pocket more than
the amount that which you just mentioned to me.
Okay.
How much do we need to go during payment?
Well, so again, ours is on a pro S and it's all wheel drive and that would be the deal
itself.
99, 99, do it signing, but that doesn't include tax, tag, title, and dealer accessories.
So you probably need closer to, I'd say $7,000 to $8,000 down.
Taking all those things in consideration.
Oh, $28,000 on the $28,000.
Yes, $28,000 on the $200,000.
$200,000.
$29, yes.
I just bought an ID for myself.
So it's still a great deal.
And the don payment is not to look to me, $28,000.
Yeah, I want to do one thing.
Yeah, there's a lot of things that a lot of people don't realize when they look at the ad
that it doesn't include, tag, tag, title, dealer, recipes and stuff of that nature.
So you've got to keep those things in mind when you're trying to get to the specialized
price in which they're showing there.
If you don't mind, if I can get a email from address from you, though, I'll take a look
at my inventory and I'll see what we could figure out for you.
Yeah.
But yeah, even home, right there, giving the book twice, but I don't want to go to that
one.
Yeah, again, I don't mind trying to take a look at it and see what we could do for you.
But so I can send you over a quote, what's a good email address?
Okay.
All right.
Yeah.
Your last name?
Yeah, my last.
I got it.
But to the BAP, you will get it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My last.
I got it.
Yeah.
But to the BAP, you will get it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you want me to take a look at the book?
I'll have her in Alice Pro S Plafus, which is the highest trimmel, which would be a different
price.
But I'm going to take a look at what I have coming in.
And then I'll chat with my manager team.
I figure out a solution.
And I'll send you over an email and give you a call back to the target.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You feel you're the very good deal.
We are going to take the tool cards.
All right.
Two cards.
Very good deal.
Got it.
Yeah.
I appreciate you.
I look back if you're good deal will come and take the cost.
That's it.
Right.
I understand.
I appreciate you.
And then I will be reaching out here just a few.
Yeah.
Thanks.
