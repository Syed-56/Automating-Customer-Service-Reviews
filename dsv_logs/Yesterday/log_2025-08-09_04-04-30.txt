Now people come from California, big cities.
It's getting expensive, but still cheaper than Chicago.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of people west coast, yeah.
They leave in California.
They either go on an Arizona, Texas now, because of our wildfires.
People don't want to stay in California.
So expensive.
But Texas begin to get kind of high too, because people go on their nose.
Not a big hit, even there.
That's true.
Nobody's from here.
You got to be hard.
Well, you got to have all your round of luck hot down there.
Well, it's super hard.

After 5 till 10 in the morning is perfectly fine actually.

But that's not a good person.
Sometimes I enjoy Chicago.
I was seven months, eight months.
You can't do any outdoor stuff.
You know?
There's a car.
We could do a mountain.
And see, bad bunch of cars was that they get, we get snow in the winter.
But Texas, they don't have snow.
And so that's one good thing.
If I live in a test, you don't get a lot of snow.
They're a bad issue.
You don't get a lot of snow.
Not a snow.
It's like you miss the car.
You must stay up the north side.
I give a lot of stuff to the car.

For fun for vacation.
I think Chicago has a bunch of more options.
You know, the Wisconsin is next next door.
Then you have Michigan.
