Thank you for calling, I could have listened to that major call.
Hi, I'm trying to get a hold of Tamina or Tamina, is that your say it?
Hi Tamina.
Come on, yeah.
Have a seat, have a seat.
You're on your seat.
Beep beep beep.
Beep beep beep.
Beep beep beep beep.
Hi, is this Tamina?
No, she stepped up for me, did we can do for you?
Oh, actually, yeah, you can help me, I guess it doesn't matter.
So I reached out to her yesterday.
I have a 2025 F-150 power boost that I bought.
And I'm not in love with it.
And I say that because the hybrid on and off is, I mean, it's great,
but I just don't know if I love it.
And I've been looking at your guys' 2024 for lighting
that you have.
It's the exact same color as my truck.
I have a screen number for you.
Yeah, I have it.
The PA won.
Okay, so this is a thing.
Like I know, she offered me kind of blindly, so they can, you know, basically your trading
movie 48.
And I shot back at her and I said, hey, look, like they're selling my truck in its
got 1,700 or 800 miles.
They're selling it for 64.
So I'm not going to waste my time and come down for 48.
And I wanted to speak to someone on the phone at least and see what
the real estate knows.
Yeah, well, she just stepped back into her office.
So hold on one second.
Okay, great.
Thank you.
Hello.
This is Tommona.
Thanks, Tommona.
This is Tyler.
We spoke yesterday.
Hi, Tyler.
How are you?
Good.
It's a little easier to talk on the phone than text.
Yeah, it is.
It's okay.
So, um, it kind of give you a little backstory.
I know this is Tommona.
Hi, Tommona.
This is Tyler.
We spoke yesterday.
Hi, Tyler.
How are you?
Good.
It's a little easier to talk on the phone than text.
Yeah, it is.
It's okay.
So, um, it kind of give you a little backstory.
I mean, it's a great truck and all right.
It's just the hybrid portion of it.
I just don't love.
Um, and my father-in-law has a lightning and anyway, I probably should have gone with the
lightning.
Um, so this is why I'm kind of toying with this truck back and forth right now.
And the biggest thing this swallow is taking the big loss on it, right?
So, I was kind of running the numbers because you guys are 24.
I currently owe 25, you know, 300 on the truck.
And the way I was kind of breaking it down is it would basically be the same exact amount.
I'd just be trading the truck.
Um, and I'm trying to debate if that's worth it.
Even with taxes and everything.
So, I wanted to know like what you guys realistically, your best out the door would be for the vehicle price.
And I can give you my zip code.
Okay.
Um, if there's a wiggle room on the price and everything.
Well, are you, do you live in Oakland?
No, I live in Brentwood.
Oh, Brentwood.
Okay.
What's your zip code?
94513.
Okay.
Um, at the end of the day, we have to look at your vehicle in person.
Are you?
Uh, the, the one that you shared with me the 2025 S-150.
Um, to, to see, you know, what the appraisal would be for that, you know, you can even get more than what we've offered you, right?
Sure.
I thought I'm 32.
I've bought over 30 vehicles in my life.
I know the process goes.
It's just the time with my, I've been working 60 plus hour weeks.
It's just so damn hard to get down there right now.
Um, that's the problem.
It was short salary.
Okay.
Um, I mean, what, what are you, what are you looking to get?
Like what?
Well, where are you, to be honest?
Yeah.
I mean, I do be like no less than 55.
I mean, it's, it's, well, he's taking a loss on it at that.
Right.
The truck was 58 something with the rebase.
You know, it was, it was really like 50 something.
Um, are you, are you starting about like you don't want to pay more than 58?
No, no, no.
I'm sorry.
Your truck is 40, uh, 49 or 48, right?
No, I'm talking about my trading.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
I mean, I, I'm like an hour of yearful.
Well, hard to say.
I mean, looking at other flaxes and whatnot, they're about the same price.
Um, so, you know, I think we're priced really competitively.
Yeah.
I mean, I probably offer somewhere around 40, 75 just to get the finance manager to bring the numbers down.
Okay, 40, 75 is your offer.
Okay.
And I'm hoping for 55 on the truck.
55 on the truck.
All right.
Well, uh, let me work on it.
Um, I'll get my sales manager involved and see what we can do for you.
Um, can I call you back in the next half hour?
Yeah.
Of course, if I don't answer, because I'm tied up on a call for service, but, um, yeah, I'll
try to get back to you.
Okay.
Sure.
Yeah.
Let me, uh, work on that and see where we can go or how close that leads.
Okay.
So, okay.
I'm trying to do.
Okay.
And then your other questions for you.
So I understand you can't apply the use rate.
Like when I bought a Tesla, I was able to get it through my taxes.
Yeah.
But you still, does that still work?
Because it's ending in September, right?
Yeah.
Well, it doesn't apply for this because it's over $25,000.
Okay.
So regardless, it's having a cheaper car.
Okay.
Right.
Exactly.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
And then I don't know.
I'll also talk in my head.
I really don't want to do another finance at 8%, I mean, kind of been toying with just paying
cash for a difference.
Oh, okay.
So if that helps.
You would want to find out.
Okay.
No, I probably not.
I mean, not that it's off the table, but I would just be curious.
What's your credit?
Okay.
What's your credit?
I would.
820 something.
No, okay.
Well, we have a lot of lenders that give competitive rates with the credit application.
I mean, I could get you a definite answer of that.
But if you're credit for it's like $800 enough, I mean, you can get even less than that.
Well, it probably could be a difference to your terrible.
There's still like in the high sixes.
Sevens.
Yeah.
That's the high sixes for sure.
Right.
Okay.
Well, and that's why I kind of want to just pay cash for it.
It just doesn't make sense of finance.
So.
Okay.
So paying cash.
All right.
And what was the payoff for your.
For it is.
Let me give it to you right now.
Okay.
And I can get in the fork pass out.
Sure.
That's a great job.
Sorry.
Sorry for it.
That's great.
Sorry for it.
It's loading.
Yeah, that's cool.
So right now the contract amount is 25, 3, 3, 8, 0.41.
Okay.
Let me get pay off.
Let me see what it says on pay off for the quick.
Oh, okay.
47.
Okay.
And one.
49.
Okay.
One.
49.
77.
Okay.
And.
Um, and who are you financing through?
Uh, this is for four.
Four.
Okay.
And it's financing not at least.
Uh, no.
Okay, financing.
Okay.
Um, so basically your car isn't perfect condition.
Right.
Yeah, no.
brand new. Let me switch this to my garage. Okay. Okay. Cool. All right. Yeah. I think you could
talk to us yet. Okay. I think I have enough information from you. But if anything changes,
I'll shoot you a tiger. So if I need something else. But that's all for right now. And
I'll get with myself manager and see what we can work out for you. And I'll let you know.
Okay. Okay. Cool. Thank you. Thanks, Taylor.
All right. All right. Bye bye. Bye.
