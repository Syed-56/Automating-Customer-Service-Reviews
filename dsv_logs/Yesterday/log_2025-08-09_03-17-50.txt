I've got an O9F 150.
So it's getting pretty cold.
You know, it's something reliable.
It's a bad amount of anything that I know.
It's a good liability to take away that.
Yeah, this is what it hurts.
It has to go over again.

We'll fix them all over the Dallas.
So I want to get something there.

But it's all set.
Well, I'm going to go ahead and jump this in.
You have an upgraded application.
I got your info down.
You're going to see that in a text message here.
I'm going to text you that credit app.
Or since it's decided to be slow.
It's having a few seconds.
That's it.
All right.
All right.
So I'm going to go ahead and check that.
Okay.
All right.
Do you have your like, off the middle company?
All right.
You have your like, off the middle.
Something's not off the end.
Yeah.

I'm going to drop it.
You're up.
You're up.
You're up.
You're up.
You're up.
You're up.
You're up.
You're up.
I guess.
I'll go for it.
All right.
And then that credit app should pop up in about 10 seconds here.
Going to go ahead and take to the belt and list of the typical credit app.
Okay.
I'm also going to see like my name and number on there.
Just so you know, me sending you not some kind of person.
So you're right.
Okay.
I guess.
See here.
So just let me know when that pops up for you.
You got to be sender.
So I got to go here.
All right.
All right.
Okay.

Let me know when that pops up for you.
You've got to resend it.
Yeah.
All right.
I got it.
I got it right here.

All right.
And then you want to fill that up and let me know.
And then I'm going to be right back in the middle.
I'm going to consult with the manager so he's ready for you.
All right, there you go now.
All right.
All right.

Okay, there you go.
Alright, you're welcome.
Here's where.
I'm going to refresh that to see how that pops up in my end.
I'm going to see if I can get that filled out, too.
Okay.
Alright, go, can.
Are you sure right here?
Okay.
Okay, I'm sure the minute that was the manager's and they should use you in a second.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Alright.
And then the final stuff has to get some info on your trade.
You are trading that F-150 correct?
I mean, it turns to a straight off of four.
Yeah, so maybe I should go ahead and upgrade it here.
You wouldn't have to have a picture of all the F-150 widgets.
No, no.
I got you.
So the first of like, actor, he phrases, pictures, always helps, but we can also
brave assuming a thing of position.
Would you say it is in a pretty decent position across the board?
Yeah, I'd say it's fair for 2009.
Yeah, we can go ahead and plug everything in.
You have the villain hand?
No, but I think you'll ask your point.
You can see here.
Ah, yeah, I feel a fair picture of that.
I can use that for anything.
As far as you just have it.
Yeah, I can honestly do that for you.
Yeah, if you like to.
Yeah, LHB 9 0 3 7.
9 0 3 7.
I can't do.
Yeah, sure.
Right.
All right, and then you'll hear.
Yeah.
I really don't know.
It's fine.
No?
Maybe, um, I don't know.
So, I hope we can check it out with him.
I'll probably give you an accurate appraisal,
really a great follow-up.
We've got some pictures and models,
really what we have with miles.
If you have the van and some pictures on hand,
we can go ahead and do it with the trade includes.
What is it we can just do?
We can do it with the trade.
And we can kind of go from there.
Does that work for you?
Last one more time you can just do it with.
I was at the expense.
Look, you heard you all could win without that.
You can't do an accurate appraisal.
I just didn't hear the line.
I'm like, yeah.
Right, yeah.
We've got the van.
We've kind of had a hard for us to do.
Well, we can go ahead and start with all the trade.
See what we can do.
And then if that's not enough to over want to be,
we can always add a trade in later on.
Just a few more we can get to get to where you want to be.
OK.
All right, cool.
I'm just going to go ahead and plug that on.
And I'm going to post that to the managers.
And I apologize for taking so long.
If you couldn't tell them to do a guy.
No, I'll get.
No, I don't think you'll.
We've all been a new guy once one again.
Yes, sir.
I'm fixing to be the main guy.
So don't worry about it.
Really?
Yes.
So it's part of moving the bells.
You know, I've got to give them a drop.
I've got to be a few things that we've got to help us out.
I'm just going to turn it down.
OK.
We've got to be sure.
We've got to be sure.
We've got to be sure.
We've got to be sure.
We've got to be sure.
We've got to be sure.
We can do a little bit.
We've got to be sure.
We've got to be sure.
I've got to be sure.
I have a right over there.
Close the name.
Well, what do you want to do to me to?
It turns into kind of having a different one
you see?
How are we going to work on the board with the phone?
Now it's time to go back to the next, you know?
Yeah.
Now just working on the fence and here.
Now just working on numbers while you're ready.
Okay, so we're going to go back to the next one.
I don't think that we've got 10K down.
All you have to trade, we're going to have to turn it on hand.
There's also people that have to trade first.
We're walking down.
We've got money down.
All right, so what we're going to do is make sure the numbers are acting all that.
So we're going to take that up.
I'm going to give you a call.
Here we are, we're talking about that, three in a minute.
Yeah, about four or five minutes and then, so it's pretty tall now, right?
Yeah, thanks.
All right, take it easy.
