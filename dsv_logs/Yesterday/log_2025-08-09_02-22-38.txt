We're having a great day over at Toyota Dallas. Very serious.
Hey, hi. I'd like to say to you, will many go?
All day, many show on company.
Okay, let me get them for you, of course.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'd love to see you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'd love to see you.
Thank you.
I'm going to help you.
I'm going to help you.
Hi there.
The first thing is targeting.
I'm doing a terrific.
I'm doing a pay.
I'm doing a terrific point.
I'm going to point out that no one's reached out to me if you're already in a status of
a car that I'm buying.
15 over a month.
And it's around four limited.
All right, now.
Let's check on that.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I apologize.
I can't.
I'm really, really far away.
I just want to make sure that I'm feeling just right.
You have a vehicle with us.
I believe it's our capacity here.
It's around four limited.
We have on the way.
What was your concern, ma'am?
I'm sure.
When it's going to arise.
I mean, I'm told that call is probably the day that they didn't know.
And I said, what do you mean you didn't know?
And it shows that if arriving to the delicious on the 24th, that's our location here right now.
This month.
And that's the, um, it's a wide, rock or limited per white with a light green tubular.
Yes.
And what is the time?
It's the, not right.
I mean, we'll talk with tires of light, but it's not, um, light green.
No, it's, um, okay.
So when is that coming in now again?
It's showing the location here from the 28th, 25, 25.
That's where it says arrival to the dealership.
825, 2025.
Okay.
Now, what happens with my contracting, if that was over,
happening with fact, if we had a, I'm dropping, so I don't have a record of,
but I find the same.
Of course.
Like, so it's different.
Yeah.
Why is he wide?
So I like, standard because of the fact that I don't have the vehicle.
Everything, you contract, you, every unit of contract will remain the same.
And it will start from the point that you take the new wheel of the car.
You contract, of course, is to qualify everything and try our entry which is,
which is where I already have a contract created.
So they can send it back to car quicker.
But nothing as far as your numbers, where you're going to pay for your conversion,
anything on the nature is going to change.
Everything is going to remain the same for you.
Okay.
Other than my warranty, if I have like, whatever, you know, warranty,
that will be correct as of the day I pick it up when it comes in.
That's correct.
Now, is that data is whatever the answer into it?
They may be come active to put it out with.
I see.
Okay.
And the number of things I've noticed is, people are telling me they're sick sales during
almost the toy owner's now.
And I included on that, or held, and I even thought something on Facebook this morning.
I didn't know about it, but my friends are being telling me,
because they didn't know that I would have had an ordering and buying.
And then I said, I'm pretty dumb at.
It's the way you better call your kids, you can choose to own other sales price.
Well, I'm here and you're being like a few of these two some options,
such as being the toy down to their marshall over.
because for example, that's the one that I have with the neatest price.
The other ones that I have, they have about $3,000, $2,000, $3,000, $3,000, $3,000 more.
So I would assume that that was the person that worked with you,
I believe was our director.
He applies to the business, to be in the price of what, for what we are doing over here.
Because the other ones that I have, my data can be coming on the same time frame,
we've done different colors.
There are about $2,000 more.
Okay.
So you can say that you've taken $2,000 from the jump on this one.
Okay.
So you either call me or hate me when back then turning on the $2,000.
Correct.
Whatever the vehicle is now, we're going to let you know.
We're going to say you're a vehicle, but we're going to let you walk around.
We're going to have that vehicle being wise, detailed.
We're going to put the window theme, low-gars,
the main protection plan for two years,
we're going to put the night training on the tires.
So this is ready for delivery, we're going to need you to know as well.
Okay.
And you can just come and pick it up, or we can deliver to you whatever seems to say.
Okay.
If any of you may please let you know,
like if you're still looking, then out in the business.
Of course.
You know, look at what's happening.
Okay.
Great.
Okay.
So I'm going to start with my red side,
but it's sold to Kabi.
How do you eat mom doing?
I can't do.
Does that sound special?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, she had an owner's seat, she's stable.
She had open horse surgery, and she's in just nine or five this last week.
Yeah.
I understand.
Yeah.
Well, I'm going to keep going better or improving.
You have a surgery.
Yes.
I'm going to let it know that you asked for him as well.
That was really kind of a good part.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, I'll touch stage.
So you have spaces for my number.
Is there any changes or anything I need to know?
I just don't want to be in the background.
No, no.
Oh, this week was yours.
Nobody else can put the name on this.
And we already have a service.
And he's already all the contractors to qualify everything they're only going to be yours.
Okay.
I do want to have on the five there.
You also have this little entrance, because I noticed the bus divided the road, or the
my legs.
Mm-hmm.
I need a little bit.
You have that I can either have or buy or whatever needs to have to have to do your, you know,
the advisors that you all have to make it a little bit more reliable, and I know you can have
a real, the kids can have the same size as the licenses.
Of course, I can see some options when the vehicle arrived because I don't need that vehicle.
They come with extensions.
Well, I can't show you anywhere, because they need something else, which we can bring
out for you.
Okay.
If it has an extension, that should be good.
You know, it gets a little bit explicitly on the side.
You know, when you get it to the side on the driver's side, it's just protection.
Yeah.
We need a key.
Okay.
Well, thanks so much.
Touch base.
Oh, ma'am.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Let's go.
You too as well, Ma'am.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
