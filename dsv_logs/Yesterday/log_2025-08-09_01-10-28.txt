Go to Fortis, Tampa, sales, this is Vena.
I'm gonna help.
I'm gonna go home.
Sorry.
I am there fine.
Everybody's gonna go.
Guys, stop.
All right.
This is one of the, I'm ready to go to school.
I'm like, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
They can be together.
I'm a parent, buddy.
They're going to go.
They're going to go over where, like,
if you get more days, you got them.
You know, but I, yeah, it's pretty much.
I saw you, so I am calling because I thought you
have a bug on cave on your website.
Mm-hmm.
I have a little bit of a mishap with one of my cards.
I'm doing accident, wasn't my fault.
It was, we had a driver.
Got a lot.
Oh, for sure.
Yeah.
You have a little bit of battered credit, though.
So kind of a short story, long story short story.
We have a bankruptcy.
It's relatively fresh.
We were planning on keeping our cards until somebody decided
to blow the red light when we're in.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, that's something.
Yeah.
No, it's not nice.
That's what I had a nice card that I was saying $300 a month on.
And now that's got the cake.
Actually, we're going to do a sorento from here of Westlake
Stackle.
But I'm going to tell you something.
Well, the sorento is nice.
It's kind of nice.
So the whistle's like, I heard hold on one second.
I'm going to yell at them more quickly because the guy
says things are screaming stuff.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
I'm fine.
Oh, my God.
Oh, we're so very close to the toilet.
Mm-hmm.
So what ended up happening is so I guess I have a voice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, we're so very close to the toilet.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway.
So what ended up happening is, do I have a voice?
I had a voice in the toilet.
What's happening is, do I have a voice?
I have a voice in the toilet.
What's happening is, do I have a voice in the toilet?
I need a voice in the toilet.
I need a voice in the toilet.
I need a voice in the toilet.
This is, I have four children.
I have two boys, two boys, four boys.
I am.
And my look at the back of the cylinder is extremely
crafty.
This is smaller than small.
I'm like, OK.
Hey, yo.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God.
So anyway, so long since I had, I actually had a view of I'm
played two years ago.
But we sold it because my husband and I are in shock.
So anyway, I love Beyonce.
Like if I tell you with the perfect family car,
I tell you with the luxury car, the family goal,
I could have that car for the next 10 years.
But like I said, our credit is a little challenge.
So when we went to PS, we did the PS app,
they put us this consumer, whatever,
consumer funding services, whatever.
The PS or the PS app or something like that.
I'm like, if I'm going to send $550 or $500 on a car payment,
I'd rather have something that I know can,
that like I know is a true, like,
if it's true, seven feet.
Do you know what I mean?
Like, yeah.
So it's three seats in the back, two captain,
she was the front.
I've had a on-play before.
They're beautiful.
And this one has a fun room.
I was like, oh my God.
I guess, like, literally like a dream come true.
You know?
Yeah.
And I'm just,
and that was kind of my question.
Was today, like, my letter,
I guess my question is,
is like, how good is elder for?
I asked the bar car for me, but I still,
about four years ago.
Mustangs.
Yeah.
So I'm probably,
probably in the system.
Yeah.
I'm going to look here.
I'm like, you're going to try to cooperate with me.
I mean, we have 60 lenders here too.
You're concerned about the credit.
That's what I'm concerned about.
It is the fact that like,
the key I made it to us is what do you want to eat
and what do you want to eat and what do you want to eat?
I'm yelling when you can do.
And I know like,
like, I love the hell I would call.
Like, this is my forever car.
Do you ever have the other head of the car
and your life where you're like,
the dishes is the car.
This is the one.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
You fall in love with it.
I do.
But it's like,
I also have to be at a specific payment amount.
Because of the check.
The issue comes in.
I wouldn't have an issue with payment because
I've had cars that were fit me personally where I needed to be.
But because I've done it any way to buy it in my office
or run the run light room and ruin your whole life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
People drive like idiots.
You know, realize that.
You know, what is going to occur from it.
People drive it in the same these days.
So that's the issue where like, I have.
So the other issue is that, you know,
I have four kids.
I want to do my payments well.
Not just because I'm being you.
You know,
you particular type.
I have other things.
I had cancer last year.
Hence the best.
And so my medication is.
I'm going to about 700 a month.
So like,
I have to keep payment still because that's an
necessity.
But now cars are going to
necessity.
That's like.
That's not like.
That's something that fits for family.
But and I don't want to compromise on that either because if I can't
have a goal to a smaller car,
it's not going to fit us.
Yeah.
You want to be comfortable.
Definitely.
The best thing,
honestly,
the deal would be,
I see you can come in and that way you can sit down, you know,
it's all my own specialist.
We can look at some vehicles, see what's going to put your family
in then suit.
We can do as far as something to think and what not.
Does your tooth or pain it listen to achieve?
Because they did it with the cemento and it was 30 grand.
And they got us.
The guy said,
I've been magic.
And I got you at a four 14.7 percent.
That's like,
okay,
my husband makes good money.
He's like,
he makes a hundred and thirty thousand dollars.
Yeah.
Thanks.
And we've had cars in the past.
We've had bottom pay them bottom pay them.
We have been any besides a little blish
where we had issues with our credit because of the bigger,
because you know,
because of the medical bills and all of our stuff.
If you will fact his car history,
he's impeccable.
And I do not kid you.
See that my husband has an impeccable on tape.
He's never miss fair.
Yeah.
Well,
that's what it's good now.
At least that there's one that has impeccable.
And the one that's no,
I've done that before.
I'm like,
what's your credit score like?
Well,
he's a good one.
He says,
his is like a five six key because of everything that had happened
just the bank of see,
and all this other stuff is an medical bill.
Yeah.
We try.
I pay homes.
I don't count on social.
I don't have jobs.
So I pay home to hit.
So everything always goes through him.
But there's a job,
but it's all
yeah.
You're not,
I have one.
I have one.
There's a six.
All right.
I got one,
six been this year.
So you know,
you're like,
I'm pretty much on my head.
Pretty much.
Let's see.
So they're kind of in my head.
I hate having this credit run.
And it's just because it's, you know, it'd be you.
Every time we do it, it's pulled us you down.
So, you know, and that was kind of, if I kind of know where
here was coming from and I know like, hey, they got an approval from this bank.
And we do a credit act.
Would they be able to submit in the same bank?
Or could they be able to look at it?
Would you be able to do something better?
Could get you where you need to be?
Yeah.
He could take a look at it and kind of look at his credit history
and then kind of see like where you're at.
That's not a problem.
And then I don't have, you know, is this your phone number yourself on?
It's both.
You need to, you kind of look at my last name.
No, just look at this one.
Whatever is your actual number.
That's the one I need.
Okay.
Yeah.
Perfect.
How does that score your first and last name correctly?
Appreciate the pair.
T-A-R-A.
Last name is Erin.
A-R-E-N-V-S-N-G.
All right.
Which is it code?
3, 3, 5, 4, 1.
All right.
Perfect.
Yeah.
I'll shoot it over to you.
And then just fill it out.
And then, you know, I'll have him work up a quote for you too.
So then get the ball rolling.
You get everything taken care of like, yeah.
Kind of get the process going without you having to be here.
I know like you guys were, when I had my minor member correctly,
like you were super like you had your tip together.
Like legit, my first tip.
Yeah.
We drive.
But oh, also that's why I'm at the ask you while we're talking.
Which, which view was it?
I've got three.
It's an uncle.
It's like a three.
It's like a three.
The white one.
Oh, it's a three.
Oh, hey.
Yeah.
I've got a red.
I've got the white.
And then the other one's not ready at so two right now so far.
It's the white one.
It's the white one.
It's the white one.
Because I have the sun.
If I was like, well shit, if I'm, I could do that.
If I could think about it, you send them a big amount of money on a payment.
Wouldn't it be better?
Just, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, if you're going to be paying for it, it's an investment.
I mean, you don't want to spend all this money to, you know, be in a beta or something.
It doesn't have anything nice.
So if you're going to spend the money, why not have everything you want that you can't afford to.
So I get it.
But I think when it's the, I need it for the kids.
It's not like, oh, I could put myself in it.
You know, I don't want to know.
You know, I've got 90,000 miles on it because then I'm in the more trouble.
You know?
Right.
Yeah.
So let me do this for you.
I'm going to hop off here and I'll send you the little, I'll just start there.
The pre approval link.
Okay.
And then I'm happy to fill it out.
Unless I receive it.
I'll submit you over to him.
That way we can see what we can do for you at this car.
It'll work or where we're at.
Look at, you know, where you're looking to be.
And we can discuss it from there.
And then now being that, like, shoot, you're going to taste credit off, like, 10,000 different things.
That was the other issue that we have.
It's like everybody spends it like six, seven different things.
Like, no, he won't submit you until we're like actually trying to work a daily.
We're here to have to submit you to know what we can do.
He can take a look at it.
So he's not going to ping you.
And we'll cross that bridge whenever, you know, we just have to move forward.
Okay.
This is a pre approval.
Yeah.
No worries.
No.
That's fine.
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
