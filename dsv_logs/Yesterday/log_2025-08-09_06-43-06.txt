Hey, this is John again. We got the connection. Hello. Hello. Can you see my text?
Uh, when you checked, give me one second here.
I thought it's actually done by this to the cold yet. Would you be able to send it?
Yeah, so but you were asking like why you didn't buy right? So one boy heard him because you don't have to call it right.
Correct. Plus I want to get the better price which is everybody wants right? So, um, yeah, of course those two things.
So, um, look at the I'm going to tell you the code and if you can beat that then I'll talk okay.
So if I'm, let me just, um, just to set some expectations if I am able to beat the code would you come in and make a deal tomorrow?
Yes. You would come in and make a deal tomorrow for able to get it.
Yeah. What if we're able to only match it which we still come in and make a deal tomorrow?
Well, I want to look a bit better, you know, at least to make me happy as well as, you know, it's not the premium color.
In my mind, I want to feel that way. So, okay. And then what was really?
Was there a big one yet? Yes, I had done service. So I don't need to drive. I know everything.
Okay, um, sounds good. Yeah, go ahead and send that quote. I'll see if my manager wants to entertain, uh, giving you a lower price than what we have quoted.
I do believe that we have given you our best price upfront.
and we'll take a look and see if this has to be comparable vehicles. So they have to be like, and actually the one you're looking at ended up selling, by the way, I think.
26, oh, one one nine, I think it's sold.
Okay. Okay. And guys, how do you feel?
Otherwise there's no point in talking. Yeah, there was no point in selling.
You're looking for just a regular light. All right. Yeah.
Let me see.
Oh, one one nine.
It is.
Oh, that was the other one.
26, oh, five one. So 26, oh, one one nine is still available. It's got a last one.
Okay.
So go ahead and send that quote on the quote that we have given you. Let me see.
Just real quick.
Yeah, I'll see what the long I do on this quote.
So being to be the other.
To be the other quote, but it looks like it is.
It looks like it's our best deal, though. I'll be upfront with you.
So we'll see what we could do.
I'll want to send the other quote is it out the door number.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, there.
Code is kind of like, you know, I think you guys are generic.
And the way you send the code.
So you'll see that.
Okay. And you can text me back and get me back today itself.
