Transcript:
I'm a question for you.
Yeah.
I mean, promotion is going on sales going on right now.
Yes, new entry.
What are you interested in?
There's a specific truck I'm trying to do.
I just see one a day, I really want to.
But you don't want to work with me.
You got to trust.
I'm trying to trust the as the two guys playing around 25.
I don't remember how you say fruit gas.
What was my G.
So you asked him.
Yes, it's 49.
I was wondering.
I don't need to define that.
I won't come out and give you $2 cash and 40 grand on the check.
That's why I'm trying to do it.
I was throwing it.
I have.
Huh?
Yeah, the stock number by chance.
I'll look it up for you.
The stock number is 24.
42.
8.
All right.
You take a look at it real quick.
And you said somebody else wouldn't work with you earlier here.
Are you sure?
No.
I don't know.
Those issues you were happy with.
I'll bump about 35 hundred series.
God, where I'm truck.
And the desk goes.
But for some reason, I don't know if he's lying or what.
So I get all my paperwork and my bank got everything since the way my bank contacts him
and asked him to send over the back over in the front and back over the, of the, of the,
the, of the, the title show that is my establishment in the area that he couldn't get the
same thing.
He's got the truck out of the, um, bought it from the office or anywhere for the
office.
And so there were in the week now we could have a, um, and so I had already told my daughter
once they're those 40 people at truck.
You know what I mean?
That's why I was trying to buy it.
So he had an amazing deal.
He was able to chat on this 40 few shows during the legal cover of the fee that the
GIV is.
So they'll be a, they'll be a $4,000.
Yeah.
And so I thought I'd have 40, too.
I had to bring 40 in the, in the check and I can bring 2000 cash.
That's the highs.
I was, I was born.
And I was, and I was for a 2000, 2000, 19, 35 hundred series.
Then I went to another dinner.
But I mean, he's swimming me.
I went to play.
And I came to play.
And so you say, yeah, I got a, um, 2020 over here right now.
He said, I'm gonna ask him, um, 43.
Am I all right?
Well, you know, we're getting working on that.
You know what I mean?
And everybody looks.
And we have a silver one on this.
All right, campus and offer whatever the case they eat.
I get over there.
He said, here's a hole.
There's a ball gap from my work from my car.
So, uh, another truck.
I talked to the guy when he lied to me and said that he can't do a outside village.
And he said, you, he can't do a long from, uh, he can't work with my last company out by the village.
And I said, that's a lot.
And so I grew with another.
Yeah, that's, but that's the biggest California state.
Well, I don't, you cannot do that.
I saw big.
I saw a good thing doing that.
I mean, it's not a good.
Well, what I'm saying is where we do everything in the straight forward.
And this is going to be right near the help you.
I can.
The truck though, uh, that you chose though, right?
Was originally $50,000.
Okay.
This county to be in a big volume store.
We want to start everything quickly.
We like all these vehicles, but we don't love them.
Okay.
We just counted it substantially.
They're off from 42,000 off the door.
We can't take care of Uncle Sam in the taxes.
That's $45,000.
So if you wanted to finance, it sounds like you were willing to.
I have a deal with shifts.
Let me do this already.
Got it.
Let's do that.
Our first already got by last.
They're called.
I'll tell you already got by that.
I'm perfect.
My baby.
Oh, yeah.
What?
My baby is what's the rate and the term.
I can put that together for you.
I don't need to run the credit.
You just tell me what they gave you.
What's your word?
They need me.
You said that you're a labor force.
I just told you they gave me 40,000.
Oh, they're not really financing.
You're going to do the check.
The check is from the bank.
What's your saying?
Look at these other checks.
I'm going to say to the bank.
I'm going to ask them how much I want to forget.
I said, $2,000.
So when I talked to the other guy, he's like,
look, I'll take you out.
I'll go down there.
Everybody.
He wanted 40, 3, 4, 12.
I found out 42.
He said, I said, I could buy a rating.
You know, you know, you know, you know,
you know, I find that's what I already got.
Take you guys.
He's a calm bank.
I could be there for you.
You said, but I'm talking for last long.
You know, the way a week and a half,
what he's done pieces.
So now I'm going to tell you,
I'm looking for another something
that says, how do you even shut the house up?
Okay.
But I can say, I can look for another one.
I'm not really worried.
I just think that right now,
there's blue.
Most of them always white.
But uh, what else do I have over there?
I have a bunch of stuff.
I have punches in trucks.
I probably have at least no.
I want to...
Okay, listen.
You just took one as I want and I want beef, though.
I don't want nothing to get as one of these, though.
2500 only.
Open the 35 for pulling.
Have your pay less.
Or 35, what was 35?
What about the...
What about the...
Okay, are you here with us?
I'm an Oakland.
What was that?
What was that?
What was that?
Everybody's a Sacramento airport.
I'll pick you up if you want to fly.
Yeah, that's crazy.
Oh, no, I could go out of there.
But I'm sorry, she likes to make something happy.
I'm sorry, I say something.
God needs to chuck the work here at least.
I'm sorry, I say something.
I'm going to look here.
I got tons of trucks.
2535 or E-Soup.
I got a bunch of them.
I got 20.
I got 20.
I like to...
I like to learn.
I like to learn how you say that.
I don't know how to say it.
That's how I get it.
I like to...
Yeah, I like to style it out one.
That's the one I'm not even looking at.
You know what I mean?
If you got something as better than that, then you know.
But that's one I'm looking for.
But I think some of that...
You know what I mean?
If you got a hundred thousand, now that's cool.
You know what I mean?
No more than a hundred.
20.
No more than a hundred, 20.
And you know what I mean?
And you got what I was for like 35 or 36.
I wish I once you do Uncle Sam,
sure, eight glass, like 42 or other 42.
I guess you.
I'm not...
I'm not...
I'm not a know how to do them, but I need something that's nice.
Why?
I really don't want to do because why stay dirty all the time?
All right, well, out of the...
All the ones I pulled out,
diesel, right?
This is less expensive ones than the one that you call the balance.
Three other ones and they're white stuff.
So if you can be colorblind, you can save thousands of dollars.
If not, okay, so, so don't just send them to me and see where it will.
But I really like that blue one there.
You can't see here.
I'm about to pay the cost,
but if you have the right light, I'll tell you where Uncle Sam.
No.
Because then you're not paying...
Because then you're paying like five good less.
I get it, man.
You're gonna get a good deal if you work with us, but it is, you know,
I'll send you what I have and you can make the determination.
If you're...
All right, so this is the new time of the work,
we can get back to the business.
My name is Tyrell.
Which one last thing?
Like the city river.
Where is there?
My last night.
I guess.
All right.
So, my name is Kevin.
I'm a central link via text right now.
Text me back if you see anything.
Hey, you know what?
If you don't see anything, text me back to you.
So, I'm blowing you up.
All right.
All right.
I'll do it.
All right, man.
They see you send a link, man.
I can't, man.
I'm not gonna tell you where it is.
All right, I'm not gonna tell you where it is.
No, somebody said, listen.
Somebody just told me they're gonna send a link
with some trust and never send it to what I call people back.
to like who did you tell yourself what I was doing, right?
I'm like, that's a bullshit.
Yeah, but he's not professional like me.
I got you, right?
All right.
All right.
All right.
Bye.
Bye, though.
