Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Sunny Vovolks.
Megan, how can I help you?
Hey, Sarah, I was just on the phone.
Somebody and we got disconnected.
Oh, yeah. What department are you looking to speak with?
I suppose it would be sales.
Sales? Okay. I'll take you back over.
Thanks.
Hi, Laura.
Hi, this is Mariana.
Hey, Sarah, we got disconnected.
Yes, I was going to call you for my number because I did call you through system.
Oh, yeah.
How was good to meet you today?
Today is it with time while you're deciding today or tomorrow?
Yes, I think that's probably making it over today, but I've got to check with my wife,
and she's got going on.
Um, you know that, or tomorrow?
I mean, are you guys barely available or?
Yes, today I am available either now before 3 or by 4 or 5 or tomorrow from 10 to 6.
Yeah, I could probably make it over by 3 or so.
I'm sorry. Okay.
So let me let me double check.
I'm trying a couple things at the right, but yeah, I think a good part of that could over today.
Also, like a small disclaimer, I know you are just looking for now and just thinking if you wanted to drive it.
This part, we have like a rule for them because we do charge your mark up.
Are you familiar about that?
Are you guys here?
We do. Yes, we charge 5000 and we're the lowest in the area from the lowest between some 8, some even more than that.
We always did charge one mark up and we still do right now.
So now that you know this, I want to, you know, this is only questionable, but we do let you know in advance and ask if that still works for you for that.
You know, we both know what to expect.
It will still early stages for me.
So I mean, there's a couple others on cross shopping at this.
But yeah, I mean, I can go in and then kind of cross that bridge.
Yeah, that's one part of the story.
The second part is that we only let you test right with an application and deposit.
So they have it more.
They charge this mark up.
They don't want nobody to drive this car.
Just, you know, just for curiosity.
They want to keep it more for not to push it to buy it, but more like those who are kind of ready to move forward.
So you can still test right with that data question application to show interest and expand the budget process.
It's up to you. You don't have to.
That's how the owner wants it.
What's the nature of the application?
It does application.
If you would buy it, but it's redo not submitted to the bank.
We don't run or credit.
We just get the information.
The application ready.
If you pull that, you're ready, then we just submit it in the refundable deposit.
That's more like a security and also it shows interest.
If somebody doesn't want to do any of that, we understand it's very much in curiosity.
And not my situation.
So there you want to feel it.
I think.
Yeah.
That's how you see the whole market is the deposit.
It's $500.
Okay.
Will I be the car?
Yeah.
So let me get you a call back then.
I'm going to call a couple earlier.
Ew.
Sounds good.
I was active for my direct number.
And then you can take your back.
The air will call me there directly.
So you don't have to call the company number.
Okay.
Her.
Good.
Okay.
Then thank you for your inquiry and work out later.
All right.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Result: [1] Yes, at a specific time or range of time within 1 hour
