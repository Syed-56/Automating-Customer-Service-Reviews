Thank you for calling yours.
I've been playing with you for the full name.
Is the no one can help you?
I know this is very difficult for this.
Mr. Folk all over the go.
Gotcha.
I had to be in the request for the C and said for the 2023 Acura.
It was very silver.
Yes.
I'll see.
I was the one.
It was like just under 47,000 miles.
Is that right?
I don't remember the mileage on it exactly.
It was 39.
70 words.
Yes.
That's a correct one.
That one is still here available.
When did you have it set up for?
Is your collabing or clicking the morning?
So, got to say tomorrow morning sometimes.
I said to be for a minute.
But I second-tenthly in for noon and then whenever you get here,
if you just check in with the reception desk,
I will have that ready for you.
You can tell the best, right?
I should ask for you.
Yeah.
If you let them know you spoke with me,
I'm one of ourselves assistants,
but don't get your paired up with a specialist.
I think it'll be out more.
Okay.
The other question I had is I did this through my credit union.
They have this true car, fight band.
We can go through the search for cars.
The best way you have came up.
And then there's a big fan.
So, all this.
And then it just went pretty close.
You take this to Chevrolet.
I've never walked through that process before.
Do you know anything about that?
The true car?
The true car?
I don't know anything about it myself.
I think if you're bringing your own credit unions,
that's not an issue.
We would just give an out-the-core price for you.
And I want you to test it and make sure everything you check it out.
We go back to the stage three, premium,
and send you with a check for us.
For some other check for your service.
Right.
But there's this.
As you said, I was supposed to.
When you said it's pretty often close.
But I printed off the close.
They bring this in to your dealer.
They had like a $500 dealer discount.
And then it listed all the taxes fees and everything.
Apparently you guys have some deal with your car.
So, it actually put it out.
And you're putting it out.
Yeah.
Everybody's putting it out and bringing it in.
Awesome.
Yeah, what are that?
We could even help print it out here if that makes easier for you.
That's not an issue.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you so much.
Yeah, the problem is we'll see tomorrow.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
