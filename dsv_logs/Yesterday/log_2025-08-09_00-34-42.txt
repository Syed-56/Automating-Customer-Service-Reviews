Thank you for calling confidence for of Norman. If you know the extension of the party you are trying to reach.
Wait while I transfer your call.
Today confidence for the norma. This is quite an helmet. I hope you.
Hi Courtney. My name is Russ. I'll call in regards to you guys still have the GX-460.
Do you have a stock number for that vehicle?
I got the vehicle. I have the the VIN number. It would be the last four at the VIN.
For LS 8. Okay. It's three four four minutes.
The last homies. Hey, my bad.
Okay. Let's see.
Ken is in the VADA. Okay. Five three three three four four nine.
Okay.
Let me see if I can get a pull-down here.
And then you're referring to the white GX-460.
Yeah. So you said how about that one?
That one is an excellent choice. I know we've had a couple customers on that exact vehicle recently.
Just in an effort of saving time for me and you. I'm going to see if that one is available
like your SANS. If that has been popular, it should take about 10 minutes.
Are you calling from a sale number or is this a work number?
It's not a number.
It's not a number. What number would that be just in case we get disconnected here?
All righty. And how do I spell your last name, sir?
I don't want to get my last name yet. That's find out if you have the card first and then we can.
Okay. That's fine. What's your first name? What do I call your advisor?
All right.
The rest gotcha.
And then while I'm checking on that vehicle is specifically only that vehicle you're interested in
or you open to others if we have something nice and clean with the same equipment and maybe could save you some money.
Yeah, just just that one particular vehicle. I know it's okay.
We'll backwards and forwards. I'm very, very familiar with that vehicle.
I just do have one question down on the car facts. It shows that the very first oil change
was done after 11,000 miles. I just want to know if there is any record that shows
that the first oil change was done earlier.
If there was, it probably wouldn't be something we'd have access to a lot of times.
I noticed that people like to they start out doing their own services, which obviously wouldn't
report to the car facts and then they realize that that's too much of a hassle. So they just
start taking it in so that it does report to the car facts and so they don't have to do it
themselves.
Yeah. Okay.
Already well, I will. Okay.
I was just going to say my inventory is around the corner.
Okay.
So sorry. We're like, I was going to let you know, but I started going.
I'm going to go just around that corner real quick. I'll check on if it's here to be available
and I'll be right back. Can I put you on a quick poll?
Sure. Thanks.
Sorry. It sounds good.
Are you still with your rest?
Yeah, I'm right here. Perfect. Thank you for holding. Based on my inventory manager,
that vehicle is still here and available. Speaking of availability, one of you are more available
to come check it out. Would right now work or would later today work better for you?
No, I never I never go into negotiating. I always find a life surprise on the phone and ask simply
go get out of the car. I need your I need your very best price on that car. Okay. Well, luckily here,
we make it easy. We typically put our best price forward. We price to the market price it aggressively.
And I'm sure that's why you saw it from from Texas because we got a pretty good price on it and it
probably beat it out the ones around you. But that being said, we're not going to miss you over a
couple of hundred votes. No. Yeah. Yeah. I just need your very best price. Yeah, I understand.
I can get that right now for you, especially since you're an out of town customer. You have a
opinion to ask something important for you to write down in the meantime. Okay. Let me know when
you're ready. All right. All right. Right. This down. That's my last name.

I'm also going to send over some of our additional information. We have just all the stuff that we
've done to it since it's been in. And then probably a video of it to your email. What email would that work best to send to?
