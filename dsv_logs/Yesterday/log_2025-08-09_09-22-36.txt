If you can be sales and ask a copy.
Hi, can I speak to you, Adam?
Um, yeah, you're actually with, um, the customer.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Okay.
I was saying, uh, you know, he's actually with the customer right now.
Are you my zest?
Um, is there any reason?
Okay.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Yes.
Um, I'm telling you about the, uh, red stuff that you have on the line.
The bottle.
Why?
Sure.
Was this a straight-run vehicle?
Two hundred equals, um, you see, what's the cost number?
Um, three, eight, uh, uh, seven, six, six, two, K.
Um, so K would be our choice.
Blue is the buyer's appointment.
They're pretty much like, you know, professional buyers.
Um, so it wasn't a trading, you know, but we did buy the visa.
Okay.
So you guys bought the vehicle?
Yeah.
From Kelly Blue book?
Yeah.
We have our KELBOC device.
Okay.
And I'm also, do you guys have an extended, uh, extended warranty for this car?
Because another warranty is going to be going out in about 5,000 miles.
Okay.
Yeah.
So would you also extend this factory warranty on for Tesla?
I'm pretty sure they're already at.
So you have to choose them.
You got some.
Will be off.
Okay.
I'm trying to see whether my house is because I found I'll come in, but I don't want to come down for nothing.
So I want to see with the warranty is because I know it's going to be going out in 5,000 miles.
And also, are you guys doing the $4,000 rebate?
Okay.
So, uh, it's going to be, so the eBay's we don't do here in person.
And the warranty is going to be a Tesla warranty.
So, um, it's going to be a factory Tesla warranty.
Um, it's going to be power-sharing or something like power-sharing is the battery.
And the rack is everything else.
Like the car.
How much is that?
So it depends on the car depending on the year mileage model.
For the back car.
So, um, so I don't, you know, have the numbers like that.
I'll have to put it in the system.
Um, but they just have to be able to do that because I want to make, I'm coming in paying
cash.
I need to make sure I have enough on hand.
So, um, there's so much between 3,000 to 5,000.
So even, you know, longer-term short-distance, less-term, less average.
Um, if you want three years, you know, they can do it three years, they can do it one year.
So the price would go low and lower for like a two-year, um, you can call it in like,
cost you the, uh, thousand range.
Um, and the higher is going to go higher.
How's it going?
And when you say you guys don't do the re-grink, what does that mean?
I thought that's some odd easy.
I mean, we would help you on story.
Um, get it.
We'll give you like the info you need.
Um, if you had a person that was going for you, she would be doing your job to, like,
classes to run yourself.
Um, so right, so, you have to get back when you're taxes.
I thought that was something you could get back in a couple of months.
Right.
So exactly.
Um, you would get back in so much, but we have to do something you do yourself.
That's all right.
So what I need to tackle, tactful.
Um, this is the same thing, like, you just submitted.
I'm pretty sure you can summarize your total taxes.
Well, clean your few taxes.
There's just one way to clean me.
What's the fastest?
Um, actually, I'm not very, like, in my, like, computer-trans
international, you know, you know, we can do a little bit, the business or not.
You should find out.
You should be too hard.
You said you're gonna still with the customer?
Um, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, okay.
I was just trying to gain confirmation on for sure how much their extended warranty would be.
I'm trying to see the outdoor prices.
There are something you can assist me with.
Okay.
No, I wouldn't be able to use them to might be able to do that better.
Um, for sure.
For sure.
The specialty.
Um, right there.
There's no difference available to speak with that.
The moment.
They wouldn't be able to get you a warranty.
What's it called?
A warranty.
Uh, estimate or whatever.
Um, right.
Would have to be a manager.
Is there a manager available to speak with?
Uh, I see the have them.
Um, you know, but if you look at it and negotiate it anyway, then you would do that when you're like purchasing it or when you like, you know, so, um, you do that with your zone, because if you're, right,
that's fine.
Is there a manager available to speak with?
No, actually, not.
No.
I'm sorry.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
Um, yeah, I'm trying to completely comply with it.
I just have a few questions before coming down.
So if you're not able to assist with the questions, I'm just trying to find some of them.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm not.
I'm not sure.
We asked you.
I wish I could.
Thank you.
Oh, well.
Well.
