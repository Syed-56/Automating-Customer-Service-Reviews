Hello?
Yeah, hey.
All right.
I came back over.
I was just going to go.
Yeah, my kid called and then I clicked over and I accidentally hung up on him.
Sorry.
No, no, I understand.
I'm just walking through my desk for stopping me once.
Okay.
Okay.

So, this is what we have one owner.
It was a local owner of the site west in Kansas.
Um,
we've been having it.
Oh, change filters.
Tower rotations all that been updated as well.
It's been an area.
Yeah.
It's a first period.
It's a first period.
No, it's been.
Yeah.
That's why I was saying it was a first period.
But, uh,
there hasn't been no accident on this vehicle.
Uh, on the car.
And if you guys come here, I have to bring it out and show you that too as well.
Well, here's the deal.
My husband's right now walking around car lot.
He hates the car stopping.
Like you have never known.
He's raised by a car today.
He does not want to mess around.
So that's we're at the Toyota dealership right now.
And I'm that's why I'm calling you because I'm trying to get all the information on the car.
If it's checked out, then we're going to come over right over there and buy it in about 10 minutes.
But I was trying to get it in the right way to make sure it hasn't been in an accident.
It's not like a buyback or a lemon or any kind of thing like that because we're finding a lot of cars that are buybacks or lemons.
And we don't want that.
For sure.
I could please.
I'm just.
Yeah, I'd be very transparent with you.
I see.
What he's not going to go in there literally.
Yeah.
If you just tell me everything over the phone and then I'll relay it to him.
He'll come in there and you get the paperwork ready and we'll probably go have lunch and
come back and sign it.
He's going to pay cash or just done.
I'm telling you it's horrible.
Like most people will be excited to get any car.
I would be.
But he absolutely just buys his buying vehicles.
And he doesn't want to spend his day.
Very hard.
Right.
Well, I mean, yeah, I'm not getting that to be big for you.
I don't want to be.
But you know, you know me the information over.
What information are you on the conference?
Yeah.
You know me the car.
Yeah.
So I'm going to let you email.
Okay.
I'm ready whenever you ready.
It's NASA.
You say APHY, G-A-I-K-A-Y.
Why?
So your phone is kind of like a Muslim little bit breaking up.
Oh, sorry.
My email is.
Nine, six, eight, three, two.
Thank you.
All right.
I'll put you to system and I'll see the car fix.
All right.
Thanks.
I'll put you in front of your room.
