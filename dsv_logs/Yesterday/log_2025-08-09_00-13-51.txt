We're all going to say it was time. Can we help you? Yeah, how you doing today?
Doing good in yourself sir. Not too bad. I've been kind of eyeballing
there's an orange rafter that you guys have on your lot I believe. Pre-owned one
correct and pre-owned you. Well questions did you have about the fun? Well it's
been there for a while. I wasn't going to buy one quite yet but you know the
deal right? I'd probably do it. It looks like you guys have had it for quite a
while. I can hundred and sixty days or something. Because what kind of deal you
can give me of that thing? I can do our average price on that plus our
tax on my thing. That's enough extra out of it. That's it. You can't do anything extra?
If I did do anything extra man because you know as you know old age units
and keep bringing them the price on it. This one is a loser deal for us so I know
flexibility wise we're going to be firm at that average price plus tax
advice. Just to be frank with you man. Yeah no worries. No worries. I give it
would be a way to open for. I don't know. You know I was really not looking to
spend that much on one but you know this has pretty low miles. I've been F-350
that I just paid off and I was going to buy a Raptor R here probably in a
year or so but I need something to we bought a vacation home a couple hours
away. It was looking for something that you know like like a Raptor that I can
take up there. I got it. So I'm just kind of kicking me around. I thought I liked that
cuddle orange. So I was just seeing if you guys would do anything on it you know.
