Hello. Hi, I got a call from this number. Oh, yes, I'm running Daniel. Is this, uh,
who is this?
Was Devin?
Yeah.
Say Devin, sorry, Vince. Um, yeah, my name is Daniel. I'm actually calling from
Watts and I, I didn't want to take a much of time. I was calling for a couple of reasons.
Uh, and this is the, I just wanted to take it. I wasn't sure if you're still driving
here. Uh, but is it like a 2017 Sonic? I'm correct. I am. Oh, oh, nice.
Everything in turn you well. Oh, sorry. I'm not, uh, it's actually sitting. I have it.
I'm not driving it. It's, uh, I'm registered because I can't fix it.
Oh, I hear you. Well, I mean, I don't know if you'd be in the market by May as well,
you know, um, if you did have any thoughts of trying to do rid of that being right now, maybe
the next time for the month of August and possibly September. Um, I know we are offering
a top dollar for all used vehicles. We're, uh, we're pretty low on our use inventory
life. So if that interests you, kind of put the money in your pocket or even looking
to update your vehicle, I probably do. They got a doctor for that. Cool. Actually, I've
been thinking about any, like I said, it's just been sitting here and thinking about
some of the only issues that it is a double title. I don't know if you guys still would buy
back. I think it's quite select, uh, something I would have to ask and I'll just definitely
choose your tech or anything to get back. So let's know about that. If it is, um, something
that we can still do take a look at is the vehicle drivable or something that we have
to probably get to know. No, it's all right. So I was like, I can't register because
since I got it, and I'm just trying to I was thinking about calling you guys, but I know
you find out the one necessarily this hot food, but I think I've been calling you guys because
I've been so bothered saying it was been a second of my, there's a recall I came in. You
guys to get a sick. I don't know if you can see that in any sort of records that you guys
have. You guys opened up the entire motor. I said you fixed the check engine might still
run on. I had it opened by the mechanics, opened up like two times, still didn't fix the
problem. And finally, I could usually idea we could get it through missions because it turned
off and then I would just go get a second care of and then, um, yeah, but this time it
was just been worse. I can't register the thing. That's crazy. Yeah. Okay. No, that's
something I'll definitely acquire on. Um, I'll probably actually go talk to my manager about
that. First off, just the package title being established and then secondly, I don't think
that we call the engine issue should be an issue. Are, you know, we know what we get
ourselves into. We appraise it. That's why I was asking if you'd be able to drop this
here because that's the best way to get the most accurate appraisals to try to get to the
most money. Um, how about this item? Let me go and inquire about that. If you had a little,
if you're at like maybe 60 seconds, like a push on a being sold, but if that is a work,
I can always just eat. We'll call it back right now. I don't know where is. I mean, so much
a push on system and just always got you there. We appreciate it. I'll be super quick.
There you go. Yeah, that's actually around the issue. Oh, that was a bad. That's good news.
Okay. So, like, oh, yeah. Sorry. What were you going to say? Sorry.
Sorry. You put questions. That's nice to enter.
Yeah. What happened? Oh, I just listened back on this. Now that. Um, so I was going to call you guys
to, like I was thinking two pathways. Did I sound the back to you guys for? I want to get a close
potentially on shopping and do engine interest. Hey, that's what you guys do.
Be a quote. You can also help me. Yeah. That's a great question too. Yeah. Let me see.
I mean, you engine, maybe you could explore on that. See what that will look like.
Do you like to start quote on you engine? And it was your question asked possibly.
I'm thinking I might need a new issue system. Okay. So a quote for an engine.
Anyway, if we were to go that route.
Yeah, and if you could, like, how much you should finish?
I might not need a full issue system, but I think the motor is just lost.
That's the point. So I keep it out thinking about coming to you as circuit replacement.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Yeah. Well, let's do that thing. I'll, um,
to this is my work. So what I'll do is, is this a good member for me to text you on?
So when I just call you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Well, that's what I'll do. I'll show you a text off.
All right. Personal style. So that way you have communication with me as well.
If you had any other questions, but then I'll just reach back out to you and let you know that answer.
And hopefully get you a quote. The quote is probably going to be for the most part in a processing.
Until we get it in here. And then like you said, I know the engine is going to be guaranteed.
We got to get it doing it in there. But the eighth thing like you said, if it doesn't have to be a full-hour repair, whatever quote I give you may be a little bit more inexpensive.
Depending on, you know, when you bring it in here, we take a look.
Okay. I'll just take that. Appreciate it.
Now, of course, that's an, of course. I'll let you go. Man, enjoy your lunch.
And I'll teach you that text right now. Okay.
Right. Thank you.
All right. But a singleness.
Result: [3] No, visit requested/mentioned but no agreement
