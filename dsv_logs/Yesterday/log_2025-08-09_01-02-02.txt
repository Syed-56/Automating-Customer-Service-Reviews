Hello, this is Bob at Larry Miller.
Hi, Bob.
Good afternoon.
My name is Miss Sarah.
How are you doing?
Good.
How are you?
I'm good.
Thank you.
I'm doing a favor, Bob.
I just have a question for you.
We came up both days ago.
And we spoke, I forget the person names who was helping us in regards to your job.
Busy, explore, that if it's your job.
Okay.
And someone spoke with my husband.
Either you go, they said they're going to talk to the manager about the prize and nobody has
to go back to the phone number to look up the information.
Yeah.
What's your phone number?
Sitting.
Okay.
That's what number it was under.
Not the one you're calling from now.
Yeah.
Is that your one husband?
Okay.
Okay.
So he called in and talked about it and did were you actually in the store too?
Yes.
We've been in the store.
Okay.
We called like twice three times.
Oh, okay.
If we get the name of the person who spoke with bus he states he in a check with the manager
and gets back to the mail and nobody calls back.
Oh, really?
Oh.
That's weird.
Okay.
Let me see if I can find out.
Thank you.
Okay.
Sure.
No problem.
And how long ago was this when Lahelas spoke or whatever?
I think I'll do this.

Okay.
from once and then the person was up in my house and said he'd get a check with his
manager. I think he gives a whole lot of money.
Oh, I see.
Okay.
I see.
I can give it luck with 300 or 325 so he can get the cost.
Okay.
You're not too far away.
You want too far away from it.
It was pretty close.
Okay.
Oh, gosh.
Would you like to schedule our appointment to come in?
I mean, I know one of those at times has been minute or eight on the majority came in.
We saw the car.
We took it somewhere.
Okay.
It's already been a good start.
It's just, you know, with the car.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
So you were in the story.
I don't have it where you were in the story.
I can't find that.
I see.
I guess I thought something.
Maybe it was.
Oh, did you excuse me?
Can you describe it?
Is it black guy after this?
Oh, okay.
This is me.
I think it started with this.
Michael maybe.
I'm maybe.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
I didn't put it in the system.
I don't know why.
Maybe that's why you didn't get a call back.
I think we spoke with a different because one day I called Michael.
And then you spoke to somebody different after that.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm going to.
We didn't go to.
Michael was helping us when we came to the dealer.
He was trying to get, you know, one with the manager.
I see.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I see.
Yeah.
I think Mike's with somebody right now.
But you want to just make an appointment to come in.
And then I'll.
I'll let Mike know you're coming.
Yeah.
What's going on.
What's going on?
What's going on?
You're coming.
What time?
What time took good time for you guys?
I don't have.
I don't have a other place for better.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Lay.
Um.
Okay.
That's about to.
Tomorrow.
If you work, you know, the outlet that on Sunday, that's my problem.
I love how it comes.
It's not the problem.
I mean, you want to make an appointment for Sunday.
I need to take a little more husband to be honest.
I mean, I don't want to because I have to get, so they don't want to give us the price
that we want.
I don't know why it's the time.
I don't know.
Well, I think you're only like $25 off.
I think they should be able to make a deal for you.
You know?
And I mean, you're not far away.
So I think you guys can come to an agreement, you know?
Because you came close.
So can I at least like a half?
Can Michael call me that just to see what?
Because the last time when he spoke with managerial swing,
I don't know.
We spoke with him to the front person.
He said, you will take a good breath.
So if they say, yes, definitely.
I can machine or if we know for sure they get into the job.
I listen how it can take off or this is worked early and come.
But they come up to reflect the work.
And then you came, why sign?
Are you, did you trade?
Are you trading in something or no?
No, I'm not trading.
I don't have a lot of cards.
Oh, it's not our card.
That's very different.
And how much money you're putting down?
No money.
That's why.
Like I said, I can't.
Zero down payment.
OK.
OK.
OK, zero down payment.
And you, if you could get it to, I mean,
I can check with them now.
If you could get it to 325, you said.
You could have a deal.
Yeah, like 300.
We tried with this 300 to be honest.
300.
But they were at 350, you said?
I think they told me I'm going to 3, 80 or 3, 80.
Yeah, something like that.
That's what they told me.
Come on, sir.
They took it with my husband.
I see.
OK.
But you're trying to get it is closer to 300 or whatever.
OK.
Yeah.
You can do it for 300.
That would be appreciated.
You know, because we still need to pay for installing the charger,
there's more additional fee than we need to unlock.
OK.
I'll put a note on Mike's desk for you.
Please, can I give you my number?
Because they're going to call my husband.
He will be able to respond to your number.
Your word, your phone number?
6, 5, 2, 2, 3, 9.
OK, and your name?
Mr. R. M. A. S. A. R. A.
That's pretty mean, Miss Sarah.
Never heard that before.
And your last name?
A. L. A. S. W. A. D.
OK.
OK.
Well, thank you for calling, Miss Sarah,
that I will pass on the information.
And so he might be able to get off early,
but you said otherwise maybe Sunday?
Yeah.
I mean, it's Michael can call me back when we know
please because I need to have no problem.
I'm going to raise your hand.
Yeah, we can raise it.
I have to ask my husband.
He can find out and just get up some more.
All right.
Come to the, you know, we're trying to work with you guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, we'd like to work with you guys too.
So I'll give the information to Michael to call you back.
OK?
Thank you, Sarah.
I appreciate it.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
