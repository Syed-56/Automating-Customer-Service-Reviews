Oh, thank you, Mr. Bevall.
What do you park?
The park department at Cambridge can help.
Simply reflect the park you are online.
And we'll call you when they come in.
Wonder which park you might need.
Ask for the park's department when our call continues.
Thank you.
I'm Kendall.
We treat the need of each customer with turns.
Girl, please.
Thank you.
I ask Spencer and Sara for knowing you.
Thank you.
Say up this one.
Hey, Spencer, thank you.
All right, how are you doing?
My name is David Goin and I have a 2015 key optima
It's getting a new engine in your service department.
Yeah, so, bro.
And so, I was over at your value loss in NAPA.
So, you know, okay.
And I was looking at a car,
and I told him my situation,
that he's right here putting a new engine in my car.
And I talked to the salesman,
and I think it's okay, but I'm not positive.
And he offered me $1,000 for my trading.
Okay, no problem here.
That is the biggest piece of shit
offer I've ever heard.
Yeah, correct.
I mean, this way he thinks,
is this way he's putting your customers?
No.
It's gonna be a brand new engine.
It's got brand new great spending prior.
I've done a lot to it.
And he offers me $1,000.
No, that definitely.
You know, let me transfer into my name manager here.
And let's figure something out for you.
We appreciate you doing this at college year, of course.
And we want to get you taken care of definitely.
So, hold on one second, Erica.
Okay.
Looking more and serve your service when our call continues.
Can't hold man that your service
straight and Bart was speaking.
Hi, this is David Rowan.
I didn't.
How can I help you today?
Oh, I've got a problem.
So I have a 2013 GIA Optima.
I've spent about $2,000 in the last couple of months into that car.
It requires a great alignment to hold my knife.
Okay.
Sunday, the car goes into the best mode
and they tell me I need new engine.
Now, they are going to replace things in for free.
So, my problem is, is I need a car right now.
So I went over to your value lock there in Tampa.
I talked to the state of manager and I told them I took the license.
So I thought, okay, I'll trade in the key.
See after me $1,000 for it.
Because it's added.
Even though no, since getting the brand new engine,
even though it's going to be perfect when it's done,
I just need a car for next three weeks.
That is the most insulting offer I've ever gotten.
It's total, epic bullshit.
Is that the way you tweet your customers?
Well, I certainly wasn't the gentleman you were speaking with
at our value officer.
Right.
So what I'm saying is, what's the deal?
You know, it's going to get a brand new engine.
You guys are doing the engine.
So you're not talking to the value lock currently.
I know that.
Yes, sir.
I know that.
But you are his boss, correct?
No, no, that property that value lock has a manager that operates
that property in his name, his host way.
And that's the gentleman.
But it's still scandal.
Right?
Yes, yes.
We have a lot of stores in our group.
I realize that.
Okay, so fine.
Why would they offer me a thousand dollars going and it's getting
a brand new engine?
I mean, the car is going to be perfect.
I hate to sell it.
But you've got what do I do?
I told them my situation.
I told them what's going to happen.
I worked for Uber and rent.
So I need a car.
Any car.
They'll get me that's where I can get to work.
Where I can work and make money.
And one of your properties told me a thousand bucks.
Now, I look at a couple of cars on your lock.
The one, the tingle, Chrysler, whatever it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought a couple of cars on that lock that I could probably
hurt his and trade in the one.
But I'm not going to get a better off than a thousand bucks.
And that doesn't work for me.
I owe $7700.
I'm not putting the $2,000 I've put in in last couple of months.
Well, we would certainly be happy to take a look at things and see if
we could better your offer.
That's not a problem.
All these dealerships, salmon, their own.
So certainly, potentially, there's a different value there on
your car.
And we could certainly take a look at your vehicle.
If there's one here, you're interested in maybe trading in on.
And of course, we're going to look at that.
And in terms of one dealership to the next, certainly it can
vary.
There's human beings working at those dealerships.
And they may see things by a little differently than we do.
So I certainly think it's worth your time to get up enough.
I mean, I need to.
So I have a rental car.
And I was going to get a loaner, but I didn't think I would need it.
And they gave it away.
So do you guys don't have a loaner over there that I can get my
hands on?
Well, our service department is closed currently.
So I speak for a service department.
Unfortunately, they do open up again on Monday morning for
the next day.
So that's definitely a conversation that could be had.
Hey, do you have a rental loaner vehicles available?
I know you didn't a couple of days ago or whenever it was you spoke
with them and maybe availability has changed.
Nice.
You're good, man.
Good to talk to you about the whole thing.
Yeah.
I'm just,
that's it.
It's a bullshit offer.
I don't know why you just have to admit to me right now.
I said, doesn't box.
That's my complaint.
Yeah.
So I don't know.
I'm looking over here at Mark's home.
Probably by car from them.
Okay.
Well, we'd love to keep your business in the Kindle family, obviously.
So, you know, I don't know if you want to weigh out all your options and see what they have to offer.
We're open to it.
So I'm trying to go on the camera.
But the problem, okay.
So I have a rental car right now.
I'm paying $100 and $20 a day for it.
I've already had it four days.
So I'm in it like $4.71.
I can't afford to wait and rent the car again because I can't use it to make money.
Yeah, it will work if you're at Edmark Toyota.
We're only directly across the streets.
Well, I realize that.
But I've talked to just about everybody over there.
There's a sales and a service manager.
Everybody asking them to, if they can hurry up the situation and get me back in the mic.
Yeah.
I don't want to call the car.
You know?
Well.
I've put thousands and thousands of dollars in that car already and all the needs of the
language.
I'm just stuck.
If I can't make money on Uber and Lyft without a car.
And I explain that.
I'll explain that to the the the the the the the.
Kendall here.
I've explained that to the the cable ram.
I was sure.
I was just saying that we do.
So we get the car fixed.
Yeah.
Well, and I understand your frustration on, you know, that's your that vehicle is your source of income.
So I I respect, you know, what you're saying.
I'm listening that you're you're shopping around.
You're considering trading it in.
You're at a dealership currently in rural until now.
So if you wanted a conference, that's an opportunity.
You would certainly take a hard close look at, you know, trying to help you make the connection.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, they got me approved without the trade on the little Toyota Prius.
Sure.
I think the difference of being our head for real for here as well.
It just bothers me a lot.
That your dealership basically told me to go fuck myself.
Well, just as I'm like, they made an offer on your vehicle, but it wasn't an offer you were willing to accept.
I don't think they were following.
I mean, these were the older to you.
He knew the whole story.
He knew the new age of his coming.
Yeah.
And he offered me a thousand bucks.
Yep.
He even knew how much I hold on it.
Yeah.
Well, and it sounded like that's not an offer you're willing to accept.
It's not.
Why the one makes it.
I think it's personal.
Well, that's why I would earn an offer when you know the person of 7700.
And there's swine, there's getting a brand newings in three weeks.
Why was you making a way to offer?
If you didn't owe anything, you would want something right.
And what you owe an earned doesn't have anything to do with how we value the per.
Right?
Like if you didn't owe anything on it, we're going to offer you more than nothing.
Right?
It would be a thousand.
That'd be a thousand dollars that you didn't owe on your car.
So what you owe on the per.
But there's saying that the offer was made because it has a blind engine.
Yeah.
That's the offer.
A thousand bucks.
With a blown-ing.
But you go in three weeks.
It's going to have a brand new engine.
Yeah.
Well, it sounds like the one that's a private-
Can I get an offer?
I guess I'm confused by the question.
You went into an establishment.
You gave them the information on your car.
They made you an offer.
It wasn't an offer that you were interested in, you know, accepting.
It wasn't personal.
Okay.
That's going to be personal.
It's just that's what they offered you.
It is personal.
It is personal.
Okay.
I mean, the fact that he stood there knowing that so, okay,
say I kicked the offer a thousand bucks.
And you put a brand new engine that he's the key is paying for into that car.
And you sell it for what?
Ben?
I don't know, sir.
I'm not looking at the numbers, right?
I only know that the values of your car made you an offer.
It wasn't an offer you were interested in.
And I respect that.
And, you know, maybe I'll love her.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm done.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'll never buy some candle.
Ever.
No, that's it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Give my car, get me back into it.
And I'll be done.
Well, this is, I mean, it's starting to feel stupid.
It's on the road.
I've ever heard.
Yeah.
Well, we potentially could make you a different offer you at a, at a,
our board trip.
You're going to do it.
It's a, it's a, it's a card you accept.
You're going to make me the same offer that they gave me.
the same offer because it's gentle.
Because that's the way your deals it works.
Well, even though you know, even though you know,
it's going to be a brand new engine in that car,
you made a robot offer that's just kind of bullshit.
Okay.
And that's the way you guys run your business.
And that's the way you, that's the way it was to me.
Okay.
Then, then, fine.
Okay.
Sounds like you.
I mean, that is a,
that is a new position.
Oh, I have to.
I'm forced to do it.
Yeah.
You just said, okay.
What's the car worth, what a brand new engine is?
Devan 8, 9000 bucks maybe.
Well, I don't, I don't know.
It sounds like you shared all the information with them,
you know, that it was getting a new motor, you know, etc.
And, and, and, and they gave me the middle finger.
That's what they, that's a thousand dollars.
Knowing that it's going to get a brand new engine.
And it's got a lifetime warranty on that engine.
And it gave me a robot offer anyway.
Well, I'm, I'm sorry you feel that way.
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's ridiculous.
Well, I'm sorry to, that you feel that way.
I'm thankful you do this an opportunity to give you information.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
And we would, you know, love to try to get through that dollars.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Yes.
Your, your flow is built up.
I really appreciate you chatting with me this evening.
I, I feel like our conversation is, you know, headed to right.
I've been happy with you.
And I think nothing, same.
Well, you're fighting over here, being open right now.
And you've been blown over the phone with me.
You've told me I'm not.
Yeah.
I'm sorry for my language.
I'm really frustrated.
Yes, I can hear that.
So, yeah.
I'll talk to the service manager on Monday and
have to get my car fixed and we'll both know.
Which one right?
We'll come.
Yeah.
You get that manager there?
I can hear that.
You're locked up to be a game.
They should be a game.
And let them know that.
Well, I'm not reading that way.
You too.
Result: [3] No, visit requested/mentioned but no agreement
