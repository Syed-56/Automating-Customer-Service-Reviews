is taking it back to me.
Thank you for calling Queensville's
wagon with us Madison.
I hope you.
Hi, I was going to speak to the
cell.
There's not very early vehicles.
Yes, ma'am.
Give me one moment.
Give me movies.
How did that tie me to?
Yeah really, very tough.
I'm just going to go to the other room.
Is that ever quiet or free?
I just thought they were.
Hi, Josh.
My name is Clem, and I was calling about whatever you're 2005, Genesis.
You've got online.
I think I felt like a gaga.
The white one.
Okay.
Just wanting to acquire a little bit about...
Okay.
We have several.
There's a white anything.
Yeah.
Would you go to stock number this?
Do you see that?
Yeah.
Maybe just a minute.
Hang on.
I told her you guys out there, but you're listening to me.
Hang on.
It is S or S5.
5v, C4, 6.
Okay.
Let me see this a little bit about, okay.
Okay.
We have a chair at the right row.
Okay.
It is basically identical to about 1-1-1-1-2.
Perhaps it is a little bit more.
Okay.
the Y-Wing was the interior grego and Titan black interior.
You have me so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Looks like, so now one, it has been run down to 27 to 5.57.
Looks like we're selling that for in-game.
Here, we're going to have a separate paper.
Page real quick.
One.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm just kidding.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm just kidding.
Okay.
Okay.
And she got me the opposite.
I'll keep on going.
Okay.
Yeah.
So 27.
Yeah.
So 27.
Yeah.
It's normal price 28, 621, and our discount of 27.57.
And then you do qualify for additional additional money off with a loyalty bonus and first-profit college grad or military first-modern.
Yeah.
So you're basically selling it for 1,000 off end-voice.
Okay.
So you're right.
People don't buy them as people per end-voice.
Well, we don't even have any dealer cash.
They don't give you that.
You know what I mean?
We have a dealer's dealer cash.
And we don't have any dealer cash from the whole of the jettison.
They don't have any.
Any different from the factory.
Well, you can just, yeah, they don't have any rebates from us.
I live in these three three right here.
Now I've got $100 off of analysis if you want to look at something like that with a bigger discount.
But I just think that they have an incentive for them in the factory.
The jettison, I'll have an incentive.
I don't know if you have any.
I mean, it's a very well priced car.
I came from a Chevrolet store before I was here.
And the Malibu, which is a four-horse sedan in the same size.
And it is significantly more expensive vehicle for less equipment and less quality.
So overall, Volkswagen.
They just made it prices crazy like everybody else during COVID.
So the user said, I could call for a lot of good money on this.
But the Volkswagen brand.
Is this either a high-work during the car business for 30 years?
Okay.
Well, I'd be gay on the engine.
I don't have any.
I don't have any.
I don't have any.
I don't have any.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I have to give up.
I don't have any.
What else to think about?
No, I'm just saying high-understand.
Oh, I know.
I know.
You remember in the rebate?
I get it.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm not getting it.
So I'll give it all up.
We're, I mean, you know how it is.
We don't make anybody on new.
We just try to turn them so we can get trade-ins and leak-in-ish-in-ish-in-ish-in-ish-in-ish.
And for them to serve as the perfect price of the service format.
No, no.
I get that.
I'm just saying I'm not going to explain to you because I get where you're from.
I'm from.
And they're done.
Okay.
So, yeah.
We're doing a good and difficult to wash up and ready for you guys to take the living.
One day we get to you.
Wow.
That's a little.
Whoa.
What kind of interest you guys got going first off?
Right now we're.
Yeah.
Right.
I mean, we have all of them.
The big banks.
The TV bank.
We have Bank of America.
Change capital one.
Our best.
We have our union.
We have a lot of different options.
There's about 20 well-fart.
We have a lot of different options available to you.
Yeah.
Senator.
Senator.
Well, it's not the option for the available exchange.
Just great that I'm not worried about.
No.
Well, what I mean is that I have the.
I'm sorry.
You're very busy.
I'm not sure if you're in it.
Yeah.
The manufacturer's not giving us any incentivization rates either.
So whatever we can give you on the open market.
That's what I mean.
That's what I'm telling you about the bank we have because we're just going to have to go to the open market because
folks like in the open market are the incentivization rate.
Because talk to us both by any other.
Not even an hour ago.
Well, we're going to get a little point nine.
Okay.
Well, I'm taking you to get a little point nine here for market.
And we can get it to get a point.
You know, I'm pushed that's all with the group credit.
If this happens equal all-side for it.
I've got a part of a 20-year-old group.
I've got 20 years in my dealer group.
We have a lot of person who can hire with a bank.
It's not just my little story here.
What bank did he pay?
He was in choice.
He was saying, but he's a personal friend of mine.
Like I said, I've been in the business 30 years.
So I called all of my friends.
Yeah.
And if they're in the business, if they've got a special point nine,
they have an advertisement.
I think like that.
Okay.
Before you.
I'm going to take it away from you.
So I'll be in.
Yeah.
If you'd like to.
I forgot your name.
I forgot your name.
It was like I.
I'm not submitting my credit.
So I almost credit ran.
Okay.
Well, I mean, if that's the card.
I'm not submitting my credit.
So I almost credit ran.
Okay.
Well, I mean, if that's the card.
I'm going to send me something.
I get it.
But I'm not submitting any.
Okay.
I'm not submitting any.
Okay.
I'm not submitting any.
Okay.
We've already been driven warm.
Okay.
I'm not being reamed.
Oh, no.
I probably get that.
If you're not even driven, I understand.
Because money doesn't matter if you don't like the card.
So we just need to get an opportunity to get me in a picture.
Hands on the wheel.
And see what you're saying.
Go around the drug and down the road.
Do you want to come over.
We're just getting ready.
We're going to come over on everything.
And we can fix it for distance.
Well, we've got our point in tomorrow at two.
Okay.
We'll come see us first.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe you'll have to go to Tulsa.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm very very committed.
I mean, we always finish at the top of our district.
And as far as that helps goes.
You know, we wouldn't be.
We wouldn't be since the top of our district.
I'm very very happy.
I'm happy if we weren't taking the care of our customers.
If you're only a bit on our way, you have the house our way from Tulsa.
Now.
I don't know.
Okay.
We all got out on the road.
It's so nice.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, just you know, with crane, we give you a next little change.
You know, these brand new cars, they come.
You choose a little every 10,000 miles a year, which are the
first first.
And then I.
So you'll get the first of them through Volkswagen.
And then the third one will give you.
So if you go through us, you want to think on oil change out of pocket
until those don't look at the 40.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I mean, you know, I think we're going to get the first of them.
Yeah.
But I mean, you might have to do it once or a bit 10,000 miles.
You know, you can always make a reason to come over.
Fire dinner, whatever.
Get it done.
Do some shopping.
You can see the same.
Yeah.
That's a rough thing in this moment.
I mean, I guess that I'm.
Please don't think you need to.
I'm just being very honest.
Yeah.
I'm just interested in the vehicle.
Okay.
So give me a little bit of a think about it.
And I will definitely.
How about I give you a lot of stuff.
I know how about I give you a lot of a guy.
How about I give them the.
To send you a little video of the exact car.
How does that sound?
And then you just come along from there.
That sounds good.
Okay.
And that's a nice.
We call them service.
How late or seven p.m.
Okay.
That'll be fine.
This time this video.
