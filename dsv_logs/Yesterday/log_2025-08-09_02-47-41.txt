Okay. I had this. My name is the one you were just looking for.

Yes.
I just have a quick question. So I'm going to come today.
But at the close sign of my brother, he's at the big screen.
So he cannot come. Is that fine?
Oh, he's co-signing.
Well, he has to sign with you.
So he has to be there today?
Yeah, he has to sign.
You know what I mean?
You think he does?
Yeah, but you're talking.
I mean, it's in both of your names.
So when you go to the finance office, he has to be there to sign.
But the teams are my brother, so busy and he will not be there.
You are also part of this with his financial guy.

I forget the name.
That's it.
It was from financial team.
They said, it was a failed manager Chris.

It was a job guy, right?
And it came from me before when I had asked you, you said, I emailed the papers to Chris.
Yeah, Chris, but that was a head.
But the day we came, you talked with the Ashley.
