You're calling first-key, let's see how can I help you?
I'm finally going to receive a message called a few minutes ago.
I was trying to make the bank now, trying to get the remaining part of the down payment.
And I need a who to limit the cashier's check out to.
Which dealership are you purchasing at?
First fee-armed or with the branch bill or no stress fee.
Okay, so in second.
Okay, ma'am, it'll be made out to first-key from us.
Okay, now I guess we're going to leave here to this open now.
I think we've got to prove our fee-to bank or something like that.
But we don't make that up to that.
So we'll render.
We just make that to the dealership.
One second.
And therefore I should be a transfer of me to signing.
But they do an answer, but I'm going to thank for writing somebody a pretty good.
Thank you.
Yeah, it should be first-key, Ms.
Just so you can verify, let me get you over to the general sales manager that I'll run.
Okay, we'll make sure because I call it a few minutes ago.
And he was given a sort of voice mirror.
I need to actually cover the person from the hearing device.
And then I'll also check it out.
Yeah, so we can only look for it once that's due.
Thank you for calling.
First, change the stress.
How can I help you?
How can I try to explain to you this day that someone's approved for a home,
your home daughter's fee-master?
Can I see a number?
But you're not aware of this.
I'm aware of the word up here.
The bank, yeah.
I see another one.
I make the cashier's checks out.
So, um, priority.
Sure.
Did I just say priority?
How well does that start with the mother phone?
First team Honda.
Okay, so I'm making an absolute to the dealership manager.
Yes.
So Elaine, hold her.
Um, yeah, just a few first team Honda because we've seen it in here for you.
Okay, okay.
Thank you so much for a bit.
You're welcome.
We'll be on our way to finish up the process.
You sure.
That was good.
Thank you so much.
Okay.
Alright.
Bye bye.
