Welcome to Night Claremont, Chrysler Dodge Chief Raph, home of Southern California's
happiest customers.

For our service department, for a question regarding a recent week, for our Parks Department
press 4.
Thank you for calling that city GRZ, Julie.
Hi, yes.
I'm going to family Campbell on us.
We're searching for a round-froll master 136-wheel-based, like fully loaded.
It came across one at your place.
I was wondering if you still had it in stock.
God, for God, Chef.
The moon in?
Pambling Campbell.
I think I clicked on Go to the Dealers website and it took me here, and I'm not sure
that's the same when it's on the 125, 136, 1,500 SLT cargo van, but it had all of the
options.
Right.
The second number.
My commercial salesmen to make sure this will develop, which gives the problem as to
well.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hi, yes.
I was really grateful for our 136-wheel master and SLT or SLT class.
That basically had fully loaded almost like a lot of the good features.
And I'm just having a hard time where I'm located, but I saw one here on why I'm one of
it's still available.
I'm not sure I clicked on it to the regular website.
I don't know if it's the same one or not.
Yeah.
But you have stock number for me.
I think it's PM0837, but I'm not sure if it's the same van when I clicked on it to make
the website.
This is the ProMaster 1500 SLT cargo van, high roof 136-wheel-based.
Let's check the Windows sticker.
Make sure I have a little mix and mix for you.
I'll show you a quick minute.
This one has, that'll be the only daytime running lights.
I'm looking for, I think it has a 220 alternator.
I'm looking for the driver assist, the park assist that will parallel the perpendicular
parts, the 360 cameras.
This one has a safety group meaning it has the blind spot and cross-pass protection and
tells it speed assist.
The lane departure warning plus, park fence, front and rear park assist system, upper
and lower side wall paneling by mopar.
This one is the spray arm floor liner by mopar as well.
Let's see.
It has a wireless charging pad, HD radio, Sirius 360, passive key, other things that
you might like.
I don't like the 77-mile per hour map speed.
I don't like that.
You want it higher?
Well, yeah, I don't want any max speed on there at all.
Like, you got a regulator or something?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that is a regulator.
Yeah, I don't want that.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm not a business though.
It'd be for my personal use.
I don't need the spray arm floor liner or that maximum speed of everything else looks
great.
Do you have anything else?
Maybe SLT plus?
Let me see what I got other than this one.
So, yeah.
This one looks like you're okay with the high roof?
Yeah, I want the high roof.
This is a high roof too, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, I have one without the 77-mile width of surround view camera, parallel and perpendicular
park on park.
This active driving assist system, blind-spot monitoring, leather wrap steering wheel.
This one has the prep AC and heater.
What does that mean?
The practice for AC wheel.
Ah.
It doesn't have AC or a theater in it?
No, it does.
Okay.
I'll look it up though.
I'll look it up for you.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, I saw that before.
I'm like, oh, come here.
Are you going to do some?
I don't know.
No, prep packed.
Let me see.
My computer is looking forever to load.
I'm not that good.
I'm not that good.
Oh, yeah.
My computer is looking forever to load.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure it's a pretty good.
Yeah.
I'm not that good.
Yeah.
I'm not that good.
I'm very.
I'm very good.
I'm pretty good.
Indicates the van has been equipped with the necessary components easily add a rear air
conditioning and heating system.
So that's all I did.
Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
can be added if you want the record. The back of them don't have the air conditioning stuff
pretty and called you would have to do it yourself.
How do you get rid of the 77 mile per hour governor on that?
I can definitely ask for you as far as the 77. I think you would have to, it's weird
to say hack it. But there is definitely a way to do it. Here, let me send you this one.
I think you'll like this one too. Let's see.
Because I don't need to offer in Lord's paneling because I'm going to do a build-out on it.
I know what most of them that have all the stuff comes with that.
Right. Yeah.
Yeah. They kind of come from here. I do love the blind smile.
So if they have the rear view mirror that's view of camera.
I don't want it to put that camera. I want the rear view mirror that to camera.
Yeah. Most of them put what it has this around view camera system will have that.
Okay. So up here where I live in a spirit, I just got back from the view.
where he said he had everything that I needed. If he didn't even have a rear view mirror,
which I'm used to looking through, you know what I mean.
And he goes, oh, when you got up, it will come on the monitor. I'm going to go move it.
If I'm driving on the road and I want to see what's behind me, you know, I, yeah.
Because this is kind of, I'm not using as a carbo thing. I'm using it more as a round town.
If I, I need to do furniture, things like that. So it's going to get struck for me. Yeah.
That's super cool. I really like that. I mean, here's the thing where I can definitely get you
everything you kind of need. How far are you pretty local to us or like how far are you?
I'm in a spirit, but I don't mind driving if I get what I want.
I mean, I'm so many here in stock. If I could take that 77 mile per hour maximum speed off of there.
I mean, and the spray and minor because I'm going to if they had a wood floor or that plastic floor, that would be great.
The problem is they all pretty much if you want the certain package, they all come with that.
So you would have to take it off yourself. Sadly. Yeah. But let me, let me find out about that 77 mile per hour right there.
I think you can probably take it out. I don't think it's like a, you know,
also my thing on it. So let me see what I can do. Okay.
Okay. If this is on sale, I think it had like a discount on it. Yeah. So, uh,
so this one is on sale with the 77 mile thing. We have a $10,000 discount on there to bring it down for 47,
and then, uh, prefer vendor and nitrate and bonus. Those two are going to be, uh,
are going to be, uh, like they're, they're basically, uh, like optional ones. So the nitrate and if you have a trade in, you get 1500 off.
Up for fender is if you go with one of our finances, uh, TD auto or ally.
And for financing, it's how much offer that?
1500 1500 and then if I paid cash, it wouldn't just be no discount, right?
There'd be no discount. Okay.
And what was the price on this one again? I'm sorry.
Uh, with all that 44, 570 online price, that's before tax total fees or any type of, uh, dealer added accessories.
Okay. So at the, not the bill without the taxes, it's 44, 670 and licensed and all that or
what, what's the deal add on? Do you think?
Uh, our, our, our add on on all of our vehicles, uh, always come out so that the lifetime engine
warranty on it. Um, we have our low jack, which is at that protection system. We have a clear coat,
which is a spray inside and out. Um, and then our caliber, uh, caliper, uh, caliper,
which is stamped on there. Um, it's a ceramic coating, uh, that clear coat.
How much is that? All of those come out to about 496, but they are negotiable.
Okay.
So yeah, I, I like that part. I would, I would, uh, I would, we can definitely work on free.
Okay. All right. That sounds good. And it's white. That's good. I like the white or the gray.
I prefer the white though because of the sheet up here we have. And you're going to check to see what,
what other ones you have or I have, I have like a bunch here. I sort of
like the, the RAM pro masters. Um, I have nine in total stock right now for the SLT. Let me see.
You want the higher.
SLT. Right. Yeah. It's too crazy with a smaller than, um, it could be 150 to 50. I mean, 1500 or 2500,
that doesn't really matter to me, but it has to be a 136 wheel base because I want to be able to
get into parking spaces. Okay. And I don't like the tradesmen package. I like the SLT or SLT
pluses. But I noticed that this has like the charging pad and things like that. All the options that
I would want. Yeah. Like the 360 cameras. Yeah. So the options.
Yes. I mean, I have two here ready for you. Uh, I would love for you to just come down and check them out.
And person, you see which one kind of works better for you. Can you send me the information?
I got my grand-daughter coming over. She wants me to, um, go in with her on getting her first home.
Social. We're going to go to that, um, pre-qualification process for her right now. But maybe the
back of me or tomorrow. I can go down. Yeah. If you were to come this afternoon with time.
I don't know. We'd talk to the later probably got three or four. Oh, that's not laid it off. We're open to online. Oh, okay.
Can you send me the information on the ones that you think that qualify for the 136 wheel base?
Um, yeah, she sent you both links as we're speaking. I was sending you links. Are they both 10,000 off?
Uh, yeah, they're, they're both 10 grand off right now. So, uh, they're about well, one's 8,000 off once 10,000 off. They're about a
roughly about a hundred and something worth $500 difference between them two.
Okay. I wish one of you like more. But let me see. I just don't know. I'm not that seven mile per hour, uh, regulator. I'm there for you.
Let me see if I can get off. Um, let me see if we can get that off.
I'll call it to my GM and figure out if we can do that for you. And if we can, then that was perfect.
Okay. All right. Cool. Awesome. Uh, I will give you a call. I made an appointment for today at five o'clock. So if anything changes, just let me know. Um, I just put it as like a
temporary one, just to kind of call you back around that time and figure out if you're gonna come in today or tomorrow.
Okay. So if I did come in and just take cash, is there any kind of like problem with that? Because a lot of cases want you to find out.
Yeah. Here's the thing, right? Everywhere we kind of wants you to find out because I'll be honest to you as a car, uh, you know, the car dealership. We do get it back in.
Uh, cars like the, you know, financing stuff. But, uh, we've never turned down a deal because the person off the take cash. So, uh, come in and, and we'll definitely work on those numbers for you.
Okay. Sounds good. And you said you sent me, bro. I think I, too. Okay. Great. And what's your name?
Lewis Lewis. Thank you, Lewis.
No problem. I'll, uh, hopefully see you today later on. Okay. Thank you. All right. Got one. Bye. Bye.
