It is a great day here at Mark Wilbur.
Finding a Sam how may I be of assistance?
I came.
How are you?
Aren't I doing wonderful?
How about yourself?
It didn't be better if I was kids.
Well, I put this thing.
Yeah, I got a question.
I'm looking at one of your used vehicles and I wanted to know I guess a little bit more
information.
Okay, I'll be honored to assist with that.
Which vehicle are you looking at, please?
It's a 2024 Chevy Suburban LT.
What's 16,000 miles?
I'm pulling that up now.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
What questions or concerns could I answer for you on that vehicle?
One, is it still there?
Yes, it is still here.
Two, it has it listed as the internet price and then it says call for sale price.
So I don't know what the differential there is.
I'm showing the price is 60,980 plus tax.
Right.
They are to go.
She ate in-house.
If you're here.
Yeah, we would want to come take a look at it.
We live in Bloomington, Indiana.
Oh, okay.
How far you're probably with four hours?
Just under.
Yeah.
Okay.
So we're here tomorrow from 9 to 6.
Okay.
We're replacing my wife.
She's got a 23 Uton XL 84.
We do travel baseball.
So we put a ton of miles on.
Hertz has got 45 or 46,000 miles.
If she wants to come up with less miles.
45 to 46,000 miles.
And you said it is a Ucon.
If the Ucon XL.
Okay.
Are you guys going to trade that?
Trying to talk and let me have it.
Oh, okay.
We're going to go.
I got another deal with that part.
I can't help you with that part.
I know.
And I just got a new truck and it's like, you don't need both, but I really like her truck.
So I don't know what we're going to do.
I'm interested in, you know, as everybody else is, I'm interested in the best deal for
both of us.
You know, there's a lot of inventory around.
She just found that one in that color and it ticks all the boxes.
And it's got all the things inside that she was looking for.
Okay.
So I guess the next step would be to see what she wants to do and then follow up with you guys.
Yeah, it looks like there's a couple people looking at it.
Let me see if we have any of them.
Yeah.
Hold on.
Let me see if we have any appointments on it.
We have two appointments on it on Monday.
On Monday.
Yeah.
So if we wanted it, we can come over Saturday.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay.
Well, that gives me a little bit to go by.
I can say the appointment for you tomorrow whenever like maybe two months.
Or three and you can let me know exactly what time you guys are coming from Indiana.
That way I can keep an eye out on it.
Does it matter though if we decide not to and I can call you and say we've decided against it?
Is that okay?
Sure.
Yeah.
