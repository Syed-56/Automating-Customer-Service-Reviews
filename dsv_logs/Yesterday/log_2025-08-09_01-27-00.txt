Beach City's Toyota.
This is Bon
Sure. Which one were you looking at?
I liked the one.
Let me see if I can find it.
I think on our side we only have two.
Wait, let me see.
Actually, my apologies.
Let's see.
We have three.
Now, we have a 17, 18 and a 21.
Probably the 21.
I think on the site that there's also a 24.
You know what?
Yes, you're right.
I think that one just is getting prepped up.
Meaning, may news and watch stuff and stuff like that.
Okay, so that one's still for sale too.
Yeah, I see it.
Because usually we only see like about four pictures.
It's because it's getting it.
You know, they're going to pretty much
smog and safety and if it is any maintenance
or if they don't put it over for sale.
Oh, okay.
Let me see.
Do you guys get in this pretty regularly?
Depending what you're looking for, exactly.
If you're looking for like a 24.23,
not really.
We'll be like older models.
Yeah, at that point.
Yeah, that's kind of what I think.
Like, so I like the 21.
I just think in if I get something with a little less miles
in the different color.
Right.
Because I think the 21 is like the brown or bold color.
Yes, correct.
Okay.
Yeah.
Maybe a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
Yeah, the 21.
Yeah, the 21.
I know it has 69,000 miles.
Yeah.
The other ones that I have that the lady has 99,000 miles.
So what?
There wanted to be.
Yeah, I wanted to be in the newer.
I guess I believe it switched to the hybrid in 21 or that 20.
I want to say that was 21 because I know the brown one
I thought it was hybrid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just trying to figure out.
Yeah, I do.
I just live with not the right color.
That's the right.
I guess.
Yeah.
It's like it's pretty much the year.
But yeah, that's what I'm calling around looking at you
because it's pretty much time.
So I'm being told time to get one.
Got it.
I'll just say, does this come check up on if you want.
I mean, you can decide if it's something you like or not.
Is that the same?
I will have the same.
I'll have the same person.
No, I hear you on that.
I have a sienna.
I bought online from, okay, I think I bought from Longo before.
I don't remember which one.
But I'm in San Diego.
So a lot of times I end up buying like North the thing.
I like LA area.
Right.
Just there's more options.
So probably won't be on up there just to look.
I'll probably just either.
Go for pickup or just pull the ring.
Yeah, you know what I mean?
Like I just end on photos for like last 30 years.
You know?
Right.
I know what I like.
But yeah.
Yeah, okay.
On that one, I guess I'll just affect my wife.
See what she thinks.
Yeah.
I'm not pulling the color.
And it's like, some more.
And I want it.
I'm kind of hoping for like 50,000 or under.
Because here's my thinking on that.
I think it comes with the warranty, but the warranty is 100,000.
You're talking about the 21 correct?
So that one, it is gold certified.
So meaning that you have a one year, a 12 month or 12,000 miles on your limited.
and then you have a seven year or up to the 100,000 on the denominator on your power train.
Okay.
What's like a power train?
I don't know.
The power train.
And then yeah.
Yeah.
You know the reason in color power train is just because it covers engine and transmission,
but it doesn't cover a hundred percent of everything.
It just covers the compartment that are lubricating.
Anything that's not lubricating is not part of the power train.
I want to say maybe 75 80 percent is lubricated, but the risk of stuff is not.
Okay.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't know if that kind of being factored into the price, just because there's not like a whole lot of time left on that.
No one is, it's already the certification is already on there.
It's already part of the price.
Oh, because they already got it.
Yes.
The majority price is still when we certify.
We take that into consideration because the dealership does pay to get a certified into the price and all of the authority.
I think.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah.
I'm making some calls.
Do you guys do financing?
Of course we do.
We work.
We all participate.
So what are you a problem?
Okay.
Yeah.
I feel like last time I sent to my credit union at that time.
It's way to that way.
Yeah.
The other time.
Looker, do you have a good idea on my message.
It's just down here.
It's a local one called Mission Fed.
Okay.
I heard I heard that one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I work with the issues that work with like send you a credit union as well.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
My cousin I think is like a man for there.
So I'd be close to actually.
Yeah.
But other than that, we don't we don't my work.
You want like optional contracts either.
With that.
We don't mind working like optional contracts.
Let's ready.
If.
Let's take your bank off for us.
The best.
Well, you can go on your own bank as well.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I can do for you honestly.
I'll create a profile.
I'll save your information.
If you have any questions, I'll shoot your text from the dealer's number.
You can feel free to text me back any time I'll get that text.
And you can have my information on there as well.
Does that sound good?
Yeah.
I didn't even do it online just because I didn't want to get blown out.
So I did get to my information.
Like so I'm just like contacting like the dealer's.
You did really hard it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Another big sense.
Yeah.
That's fine.
I mean, I mostly I think that one like I could talk with the right.
Right.
Yeah.
I just don't know how long you I'm an honest that I just prefer to try like get to a number
or make a decision.
You.
So far.
Which I think it's been pretty cool with for the most part.
Like I don't really have a lot of like graphic experiences.
What are they?
I see.
Let me see this one.
Does it have my shoes?
Oh, that's why that's why I say that.
That's why I didn't even go through like the steps on the website.
Like what's your e-prides or anything.
I just want to enter my information.
So our our inner price because I see that it dropped.
This is a unit.
It just got in for right now.
It's 3795 because I'm looking at my, um, my sheet.
This curve we had to hear me for like 21 days.
And it was priced at 39 to 68.
So they just they just dropped it.
What they dropped it to 38 basically.
Basically at 3795.
They talked about 30.
About 30.
$300.
Cata.
So.
So.
And to be honest with you.
Because I'm looking because I have my spec.
Actually where I can tell the vehicles.
Yeah.
And this is going to be the best price because I'm looking at.
In it for.
Let me see.
I'll take a real quick just so you know.
Yeah.
Now from wheeeped pay 30, 172.
I mean, that's our cost overall.
Like whatever main is and what is the certificate.
Try it to it.
So we have 31.
So we're like.
Let me see.
We're like about 200 bucks difference losing 200 bucks. Yeah, put it like that. Just some of it out of here. Yeah
But yeah, so I know that that wouldn't be that wouldn't be the one to try to
Should I work on price?
Well, no just because I know what they just did the price drop in
I know they're not gonna budget on that and to be very transparent which I know you you bought
Polycuzzal overlay you know how most eliches have like added accessories. I'm not adding up to the price here
Yeah, so that's something that's not even factored into the price of this
It's all be realistically being very transparent with you. There's something that this vehicle at least I can work with
There's some other vehicles that I'm I could say like I might not be able to work with because we're more deeper
Maybe on the vehicle, you know
Can you I don't really understand what
So I have about vehicles from other dealers and but I just I don't buy a lot of a goal
You know what I mean like it's right
When I'm not usually what they are usually when you go to especially L.A. Orange County all this area
So-cout there's even some that add on like extra accessories, which is like the at the anti-test device
paint protection
Doorage part of
Yeah, I don't want it. Okay, so the dealerships usually add those that's something that I still not reflecting the price on
Our car but like I was telling you being realistic that's something that I can definitely work with too on that
Compared to maybe another vehicle were word like any worse, you know, then I'm like no, I can't take those accessories that it has on
Was it too late like on that vehicle like everything's already I don't I don't really want anything added on well
Let's say well, let's say if I'm able to do what I did and I mean those accessories like like the alarm is just gets deactivated
Yeah, yeah, that's fine. I don't I don't really want that I mean I live in San Diego
I live my kind of a little bit of the outskirts, so I don't write I guess you I mean
There's a door in the distance for for living out here
You don't need this car alone
