The heritage, this is Brandon's.
Hey, Brandon was looking to talk to you.
He's currently with a customer in hockey.
I haven't reached back a lot.
Where, what is your name?
Brandon.
He's going to go with Brandon.
Okay, cool.
I'll get you something to somebody right now.
What's that?
What's the problem?
What's the problem?
You want it?
You want it?
You want it?
I want it.
Hello, this is Greg.
I'm going to take a look at the type of game I need.
I'm going to take a look at the game I need.
Yeah, so deal with the deal with that.
He's on the phone right now with another customer.
I was actually the one.
I'm actually the one texting currently.
It's for the random stuff, right?
Oh, you texting me right now?
Yeah, yeah.
It wasn't, it wasn't real.
Yeah, I'm a self manager.
I was the one texting in here.
Man, that's what we're going to take as a geostets to be the whole time.
Jesus, my bad.
It was, it was, we, we, we set up the thing to eat.
We took a little bit of a meal.
That's cool.
Yeah, we're still looking at it.
So my, my, I guess I got a little confusion.
I don't know if you can call it to you when I talk to him.
I've never purchased a dad's G-gram in your dad ever before.
Yeah.
So your, your paperwork is a little foreign to me.
I'm perfect.
Okay.
So it shows the price of the vehicle at 69, 602 before taxes,
fees, and equipment, all that.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I guess what I was, all I'm trying to figure out,
you sent one or two or someone sent me a sheet,
showing 6.9% interest with the 10,000 that I agreed to put down.
Okay.
Okay.
Which on the other truck was like 9.99 a month.
I, I'm looking to be at like 9.7975 and I'm willing to come down tomorrow and take it up.
Okay.
So I'm, I'm just trying to figure out what we got to do to do this close to that number or at that number as possible.
I mean,
I'm ready.
And I don't know if you're trading a while is including the downside or not.
Yeah.
But I do.
I didn't do the quote.
Another manager's defense about what's in here.
But let me, let me look at that.
Okay.
I'm going to pay for a dozen trades around the 27.5.
Okay.
So.
Okay.
So.
Okay.
So.
Okay.
So.
Okay.
So if I win, I'm, what I'm looking at your trade.
Okay.
Let's just say I give you, let's just say you get.
So I'm, I'm looking at the value for your trade.
What, what, what I have to reach on this board.
Not by the party, but I have to deal with your win is win is win is the bank and a look at it.
When I request those banks, they hate to eat it.
They expect for a food for me.
They just say, hey, this is the limit you saw that before.
Which is pretty much taken.
But even if I gave me 29 to the trade, they gave me the track.
It was great.
It was so a threat.
And I just have a little thousand from the back point back.
Um, you can use it a little bit ago.
Um, even with that at 6.9 and the lead nation, everything else,
you're still out of 1,000 45.
Because we were at, we were at 9.99.
The board trade, the board trade came with a play.
We came down with the same way.
Everything else is still the same.
But now the trade got going in.
The trade, the trade nation, the trade makes the heart of the game.
It's a little hate to get it.
So with the tax credit, we did what 31-4.
I think it was about, yes.
We have to look at five.
We can do this with the release of the map.
Okay.
So if I...
That's four.
Yeah.
And if you're still...
All right.
I know it was a time.
It was a really good number.
The number is what we have.
There's so much around the map.
And the lead is a good number.
We need to have a new target.
Okay.
You good?
Yeah.
You sure.
You know, they said early.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, they're like a hard job.
The possibility is to have the key to the key.
But when you get to get to the right, the key to the key to the key to the key to the key.
The key to the key to the key to the key to the key to the key.
I do think that like even since there's been a Friday's now,
no idea what I mean by getting there, I think it is very good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I do think there's three different things here.
Yeah.
Cool.
Cool.
Okay.
Don't want to write a burial.
Yeah.
Not problem.
So the other thing is, it's showing more money off on mine than you guys have on this sticker.
This is the baby's again.
So the white ones, the white ones that I'm looking at, so 69 drill, 16, minus 2 grams.
So the final, the final, the final, final drill.
The big one is the area where the box is in the corner.
And if you still look at the gray one, it's a little bit different.
So the white ones, if you look at the box number four.
Right.
The paper that was sent to me has the price of 69 602.
That's not the 67.
All first.
Sorry, sorry.
I'm recording.
So the price of 69, so that's the price of 69.
And then the same is different too.
So the text, if you look at it, if you look at it, I don't know why the rebate doesn't
reflect on the detail breakdown.
But if you look at the, if you look at the opinion, little box, it goes over here to
the background.
So 69, so it's 99, so it's 99.
And then we're going to be able to look at the lighting.
It's 11, 6.8, which is something that's going to be a little bit different.
It was reflected in the handle.
It was reflected on the other box.
And the white one, right.
So let me just put it in three times a little while.
So I just updated it now.
And we're thinking, yeah, still so sorry.
I just got to leave them.
Now I'm even more than just now.
And I want to.
I'll be taking 12, so I want to.
Well, I want to.
Well, shoot off.
Yep.
And then I think you'll quote me as the 29,000, but you'll out.
I, it reflects the last time.
So the text, it's going to be the price.
So from every angle.
I mean, those are the latest arrays.
Looking at the top.
Well, that's correct.
Well, I was confused.
I was trying to figure out how you guys did it.
Because I did it.
So I usually have bought on sports over the years.
They actually show the tax credits and separate section.
That's what was confusing you do.
I got to.
I got to.
I got to.
Yeah.
But yeah, if you look at the taxes, they're, they're aggressive.
They're different from the first quote.
That was that thousand would be different.
Well, it's a plug to them.
That.
But we can't.
But we can't.
Look at it.
That's why I start.
I was going to say how much more money than I have to put down to make the payment.
Say 90.
Just a drop like 60.
So if you put four grand down, it would be exactly 90.
So I'd have to put 14,000 down.
14,000 down.
Yeah.
And if you look at.
I mean, if you could use them.
So let's look at the.
The long term break down by all if it's beneficial.
So if you have the difference.
That's what I just sent you.
It's about what 60 is exactly $50.
So it's $50.
$84.
It is about $5,000.
From the $50 to those.
So those things.
I should use finance as before.
The entire course of the.
Of the law.
More people support.
Yeah.
I think you say the.
You say the.
You say the thousand bucks over eight or four.
But you know the four grand down.
So if it's just missed you.
I would say there's a little bit there.
That makes sense for you.
Apply the.
Yeah.
I've been just painted.
So you're comfortable.
But I get that.
Yeah.
I hate the four digits.
I'm just.
Oh, I'm.
Yes.
There's a reason where I get that.
I get it.
So you know, it is what it is.
So.
I'm.
The.
The.
Yeah.
I'm doing it.
So yeah, the 14 14, yeah, we'll put it exactly.
Nice.
What I'll do.
Nice.
I guess my other question is,
it does balance you to 79,000.
So that.
Let me see.
Oh,
you can bring it to that.
Right.
Yeah.
We.
We.
It doesn't reflect the.
That is what I'm going to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Whatever amount.
Yes.
So what that.
What that.
That.
So.
It's how we get through our deal.
And then.
You know, typically,
I won't have free money that I'll do.
So it's getting reflected out the gold.
We've got down to the.
You can bring your blouse.
So.
Whenever.
I'm not due to type of deal.
You're reflected on that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Let me.
Let me.
Let me put up just for a minute.
And I will give you guys a call back.
Okay.
Cool.
I appreciate it.
We'll talk to you.
Thank you.
All right.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Result: [2] Yes, at a loose time or range of time exceeding 1 hour
