Kevin, you're too young. How can I direct your call?
Hi, I'm inquiring about a car that shows up on Elton's inventory.
Yes, we're looking at a new vehicle with us or was it a pre-owned?
Certified ground.
I'll take any one second. I can see what these cars do.
Thank you.
Hi, it's a great day of coming in here.
It's a good route out of me, I'll see.
Hey, I am inquiring about a vehicle that shows up on Elton's inventory.
Okay, great. Is there a specific vehicle you have on your own?
Yep, it is a 2023 corner.
2023 corner.
2023 corner.
Okay.
2023 corner.
That's our pipe premium black outlet.
Okay, perfect. Yeah, it's a great choice. That's a really nice one, actually.
Yeah, we'll catch our items.
Yeah, we'll catch our items in the vehicle.
I'm turning on the next one.
Well, for us, you also have it, correct?
Yeah, we still have it.
Okay, cool. Yeah, for sure.
So I had a 2019 four-member.
It just recently cut totals out.
I'm devastated.
Oh, no. I'm really good.
I'm really good.
I'm sorry.
So we're feeling ever. I'm going to use shoes too.
And I hate that.
Yeah, it was a week before I had a baby too.
So, yeah. Oh, my goodness.
They're going to look like they have a shake.
Yeah, it was terrible, terrible timing.
So I am in the market to replace that vehicle.
This one caught my eye.
I'm curious.
So I'm going to be honest with you.
I live in the Dallas area.
So this is a bit far for me to drive to come, you know, take a peek at it.
But I'm curious about it.
I like the mileage that it has.
So that's kind of where I'm a bit drawn to it.
I wanted to be moving with a round that mileage.
So 43 is pretty high for me right now.
Which is obviously what you're asking.
What can we do in terms of negotiation?
Yes.
I mean, we're just going to do a negotiation over the phone.
At least not right now.
What I can do is I can get your information.
And then I can give you a call back once I talk to my manager.
See who I can give me.
You know, what he can break down for me.
I'm not talking even like this.
You know, that's real.

So, uh, talk to them to what I could do for you.
And it's a really nice vehicle.
