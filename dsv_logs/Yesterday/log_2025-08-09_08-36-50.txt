Thank you so much.
I'm sorry.
I didn't quite get your name or just your name in the history.
Oh, my name is Malo, and O.E.
Malo.
Okay, how about my name?
What's wrong with the book?
I was looking on your website, and I found it's like 25 silver forest or a premium,
but I was wondering if you have one that's the option, if I can just see, the one that's
like blind spot, indicator, you're looking for an outback, a 25 outback with the premium,
with a blind spot.
For the 4th, or the 5th, or the 4th.
Yeah, let me see what I have, you look for a premium.
What do you mean?
Yeah, and if you want to ask me, what could you sit in a 4th or a premium?
I have a 4th, an older one, but I don't want to even know.
Okay, awesome, so let me see on my website what I have available.
When you show it to package 15, I'm so sorry, do you mind me saying your name one
time?
Rosed, I know.
Rosed, I know.
Rosed, I know.
Rosed, I know.
Rosed, I know.
Rosed, I know.
Rosed, I know.
Rosed, I know.
Rosed, I know.
Okay, so it's like my name is Mohammed but I just go by low.
So, but I'll be here.
Let me see on...
There's a way we can actually see a different way, not on the website.
So, 4th or with a blind spot detection, right?
Uh-uh.
A more secure premium, let me see.
Or I have a color.
like is there a call you're looking for or it's kind of like open a little open?
Um, but any word, I prefer red or black words.
Okay. Let me see if I have anything.
So let's see.
So what's like I have a couple of
I have one that is gray.
It's a magnetic magnetite gray.
So it's like a dark gray, basically.
Uh-huh.
And then I have another one.
And that is
River Rock Pearl.
So it's actually, it's a different gray.
So it's like a flat gray.
It's a really great color.
It's very popular.
It's not like a sparkly color, but a flat gray.
They're very, they're pretty hard to find.
But we have a few colors right now.
I think we'll have the blind spot monitors.
Okay.
Um, I do have another question.
You have any something in like mid-
I love New Dog.
It's not as mid-August.
Like 20, 20, 25.
Is it just because of color?
Yeah.
What do you, uh, remind me you said if you like red, right?
Red, black, or blue?
You want to black or blue?
Cause I have.
So we work with the 50-D
50 area where we can actually
protect the, like, you can come and drive the car
to make sure you like it first.
And then if one of our 50-D
lives, we can actually have the color that you want.
We can just basically agree to numbers.
And then we can do a trade with them so that we can get the color
that you actually want as long as they have it as well.
Yeah, I have.
I have to make sure.
Okay.
Nice.
How do you like it?
Uh, I love the car.
So that's what I'm going to start specific that I want this one.
Okay.
But I'm not missing from the gray.
Yeah.
So I mean, yeah.
I think I should be able to actually get you into a different
color of one.
Let me see what's available here.
We're located in the temporary area.
Um, right now I'm in Texas.
But I was thinking of, I was thinking of moving upwards.
Not in Colorado, but Colorado is one of my way up.
Okay.
Might be going up to Seattle.
So might buy the car in Colorado and then drive up to Seattle.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Four.
Yeah.
What are you, what are you thinking about, uh, person?
Uh, person.
Yeah.
Like, uh, if you are thinking about person vehicle, I know you said you're thinking about moving.
So, um, what's the time line like for you?
Yeah.
I've been working on the other side.
Uh, maybe the next two or three weeks.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well, it looks like I could do that.
I could actually get, I can't tell probably what I see the other black one.
There's a couple that are coming in and, and there should be here on the smaller ones.
There's no, no like external factor that could potentially ruin that.
But it is also, uh, to the red.
So the, the black ones I can get basically needed.
The red ones look like they're, they're estimated or the red one that that's made to be
here in, uh, sometime in, in auger.
So, yeah.
That's like basically all that I'm saying.
So, let's maybe date all of us there at once.
It'd be midway auger.
Yeah.
But the black one is, it's going to be very long.
You're just a bit.
Yeah.
I can get you that like immediately.
Okay.
Got it.
Okay.
Yeah.
What's the, so you're thinking here, I'm going to attack you from my personal.
Um, so you have my, my contact info that way.
It's like you want to, uh, you know, message me and give me any updates as far as like what
you're looking at as far as the timeline goes.
I would love to, you know, help you in, in doing your business and the search, you know,
anything at all that's, that's, uh, you know, gonna help me differentiate myself from any of
the, you know, other dealerships.
I love to do that.
I would have its price or, you know, whatever else it may be.
So, uh, I just texted you also just my name and then the dealership name.
And I'll tell you.
Okay.
Yeah.
Is there any other questions you had at all?
