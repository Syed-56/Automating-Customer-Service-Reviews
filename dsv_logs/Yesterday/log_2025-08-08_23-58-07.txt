Thanks, Robert Hayes.
It's very good on this, okay?
I think so, but it's ridiculous.
Okay, so actually need to see if I have a question for finance, actually.
All right, how come I help?
Well, so, okay.
So I've been looking for an E class.
And physically a group, but they're very hard to find,
but I've had to compromise on a four-door.
I did look at your store, but there's none
it really stuck out for what I'm looking for.
But, funnily enough, they have a 23E,
350 white four-door with 20,000 miles on it
at the school BMW store right next to you guys.
But, obviously it's not a certified car
for a different come with an additional warranty.
So, if I bought that car from them, can I go to you
and buy a additional warranty?
Because I want to, you know,
first, it's trying to sell me a warranty,
but I want to make a new warranty.
So, you're only purchasing a new warranty
as the purchasing dealer being a Mercedes store.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
So, you want the E class?
Yeah.
And all the ones that know that,
and the reason I haven't is because they're ugly as hell.
So, I've had to say that 24 would be the highest that I would go.
Can you comment?
Well, I might have another.
Here in a second.
Well, so, while you're looking,
I mean, and I have looked at the website,
I was prepared a white or silver car with a dark interior.
And then I also, the other thing that's making this whole thing hard
is I need whatever package.
I can see the weight are cruise and the length.
Ah, okay.
Yeah, that does change things.
It does.
I have always been a electric driver.
And in the last two,
and my current one, it's standard equipment.
So, I've never had to make sure
that.
So, I have several E classes here in the line.
Let me see if I got interior darker.
Same type.
Oh.
How many things Mojave silver do you know that was like?
It's not like an old man can tell her.
No, the can of the lot lighter than the Mojave silver.
Mojave silver has a lot of silver in it.
I've got the Angie Ryan package on it.
Okay.
So, how do you have an exchange here?
You've heard of use one.
You've heard what?
I haven't used Angie here,
especially very affordable considered their 80,000 brain air.
Well, I see 100 now.
Well, that one may be a little more.
I need to stay low to 50.
So, would you say 60 for any of you?
Not, I mean,
not saying it's not worth it,
but it ain't my budget.
Gotcha.
Oh, that's the source.
Wow, that's a kick-hike.
This one here.
I've got a beautiful chocolate brown with black wood grain
20,
born a
gray metallic exterior option.
Okay.
Can you send me the link or picture the method that this is not my?
Yep.
Hold on.
I got it.
One.
Okay.
Can you send me the link or any error pictures of it?
Is this the same amount of black?
Yep.
Hold on.
I got it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is this Jason Wright?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So,
that was a lot of mild.
Yeah.
And while we look at that,
I'm going to verify a couple other features to make sure
had.
Come on.
So, when is the warranty end on this?
And then we've got a lot of mild.
Well,
I could have to be well within the size that's kind of what's going for.
Hang tight.
Oh, man.
This one doesn't have the feature in the viewer's deck of it.
I'm trying to keep it from the hair.
But if I can hear more of these are five years long.
Okay.
Let's see here.
I thought I'm going to have some of the dressing list too.
Yes.
Go to the D card.
Are you planning on stopping by school next door?
Yes.
It's, it's up in the air.
We were not quite on numbers.
And,
as far as the new car,
they have the pretty mind.
But we're, we're about $1200 a part.
And so, I finally gave in and I said,
look, I think it just looks different.
And there's still a well.
We don't know.
I'll have to ask in the set together.
And it's just kind of pisses me off because I,
you know, we're talking about $1200 but at the end of the day,
they're not losing any money.
They're not making maybe the margin they want to make.
They're not in red by any means.
And,
and from,
this would be the fifth car I bought from school.
And it's like really.
So,
we'll see,
I'm on to the kind of over it.
And then the fact that I can't buy a warranty for it now.
I mean, I can't,
but I want to,
I mean, I can't,
but I want to.
I'm not dealing with some third party culture.
And,
so that may,
that may not the car completely out of.
Go ahead.
What do you like,
what do you like,
are you close by,
are you?
I mean,
I'm not,
I'm in color.
I feel like 15,
14 minutes.
Well,
I'd love to be able to help.
Is there,
have any time stuck by today tomorrow?
Or,
I'm sure I can figure out a way to help you.
I'm just trying to,
it's harder to,
when we're just on the phone,
versus I can go grab like a,
you know,
a director,
somebody who,
you know,
they like to have people in here.
And they might have something in mind.
I can help you that I don't know about or didn't think,
uh,
for instance,
you know what I mean?
Um,
I don't know.
I can see it on me becoming in tomorrow,
but,
we'll see.
I'm not,
I'm not,
I'm working with help and trying to find something,
but,
I mean,
to do it in part and just let's take a during your first.
This is not about,
about you to me.
I put you in front of a director who would have more information than I personally want.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
No,
no,
no pushing of course,
because I just know,
because I don't have to try to help.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
no,
I get it.
And,
and,
if our conversations go any further out of our,
I'll apologize.
I've been looking for,
um,
a while now.
And,
I haven't found exactly what I want,
and even when I compromise,
I feel like I still can't get what I want.
I,
you know,
fine, I'll pay more.
Or,
um,
you know,
I'm not going to buy it on
dimmer state,
even warranty versus third party,
that's,
that's a non-negotiable.
Um,
but,
uh,
I hate the carbine process.
I feel like it's just a credit for you to be here.
And,
I,
I fucking hate it.
So I'll just,
use only you and us.
Um,
you're good.
I feel like I'm going to get insurance.
So,
you know what?
Don't get me out.
They're waiting.
They're waiting.
They're waiting for me to go.
They're just,
they're just,
they're just like,
what do we know?
No.
Oh,
oh,
I'm just,
you know,
all of it,
you know,
it's,
I'm like,
I try to make it easy.
I can.
You know,
I'm like,
yeah.
Um,
that's actually one of the reasons,
um,
I'm getting rid of my car is,
um,
I have a license I have,
and which is nothing special.
Oh,
that's a little bit so hard.
But the problem is,
is,
well,
one of the issues is the interest.
It's going up and up and up and up.
And I have good credit.
I have no,
take it,
no claims.
Nothing.
And I'm paying almost three thousand dollars a year for insurance.
And I had gotten my renewal.
And my insurance lady is like,
Lexus are just,
uh,
I kind of have a scoring system,
but she said they are,
uh,
just expensive period.
And she said the fact that yours is a sports car is even worse.
So she said,
my suggestion is to get rid of it.
Here's a tip.
Believe it or not,
the more technology and the more features you have it
and a far higher insurance will be because it costs more to repair.
So when you want specific text features that are,
you know,
my hands.
And those are high.
So you can computer items with radar and stuff.
Those even more such as a repair and there for the insurance.
Which first or more.
So believe it or not,
the numbers of cars or less insurance can be stupid.
And,
you know,
oh,
it's not here.
It's right.
It's for teachers.
It's just, you know, like a year or so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Even if you start off to any area, it's got like something
hard, just like you need to take your hand.
You know, suppose they say the same type thing in voice.
All right.
All right.
Well, I'll look for more as a Westlake where I get back to the office.
And then I'll text you.
Fair enough, my friend.
You stay in the background.
Thanks.
Thank you.
