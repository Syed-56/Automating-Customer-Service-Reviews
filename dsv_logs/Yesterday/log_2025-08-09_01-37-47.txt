to the common pressure report. This is a bit of a home. I hope you.
Hi. I've been working with Omar and somebody else, but hold on. It seems like some things
are getting lost in translation and this is like day two and I truly just want to try and
get this wrapped up. I don't think it's that complicated. So I live out of state. I live
in Phoenix. Okay. We've already agreed on the price of the vehicle. That part
is easy. So all of them are asking them to do. Have you heard of an out of state packet?
Out of speech. Okay. So basically the only thing that changed and I sense in my diagrams
everything. So what it is is that I know I have to show up in saying documents and stuff
and that's fine. But then we're going to put it like on a truck and have it delivered to me out here.
And he's only like taking the back for that. So I'm not even going to be driving it there.
So the bottom line is that I have, you know, told them that it's literally just the sales price.
And then instead of paying the California VMV fees and financing California things, it should be zero to do with California
because the car will never be driven in California. I'll never be registered there.
So I will provide a number with the R. Yeah. Yeah. I have everything. But what he's giving me had shows like California like VMV fees and stuff.
And I'm like, no, for an out of state, I don't need to pay that. And I even put down like, it's like, you guys is a thing.
So it's like an e-mail or something. It's a lot just to be letting. So then you get my research. I cannot make things stuff up.
I've got hard from out of state before. So the bottom line is it's like, I just want to pay my, I want to roll into my loan, my taxes for here.
Right. Because we're just a little bit less than you guys. And then I want to roll in my DMB fees for registering it here.
I don't want anything to do with the California things because again, the car is not going to be registered there.
It's only going to get from there onto the truck and then here. And so if he does that and then all he has to do is put that together and put it into the mailbox and send it to the Arizona DMB.
And then they set up the title share. And the other reason to do that is that it doesn't cause a minimum of like six weeks delay because that's how long it tastes in California.
So get the title issued there. And then we just have to redo all the fees again from paying twice on the DMB fees and it's not necessary.
All right.
So it does all over here. So what can you be providing the finalize numbers and everything based off your address in Phoenix.
Okay.
I mean, I really, I made it like dumbed down where it's super easy. It's like the self credit. We've read on with $30,495.
And then it says that my my tax rate is 8.1. So I want to add in the $2,400, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000.
And then like you guys have like an $85, I'm going to pay that. And then for my Arizona registration title and play it's $530. So I want to put that in for my DMB in Arizona.
And then I have like these other fees. So then the total should be $33,580 and then record.
And then like if you can just understand this that I'm ready to go on to the next thing and I'll do my credit thing and then we can put this to best and I can get out there and finish it.
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Let me, let me get with Omar so I can let him correct this instead of over again for you. And you sure hear from him.
Pretty. He's coming to call me. I don't know. One o'clock or something. Is it only a month to blow me now? Yeah. I just thought. Yeah. I just thought I'm walking by.
Yeah. Is there anybody else that can like then I'd obviously package that I can get this done this?
Yeah. Let me get with my sales manager too. So I can sort this on out. Okay.
So please, I'm getting frustrated.
No, don't worry about it. No, don't be frustrated. I got you.
All right. Thank you so much. Absolutely. Do you have a good one? Okay.
Okay.
