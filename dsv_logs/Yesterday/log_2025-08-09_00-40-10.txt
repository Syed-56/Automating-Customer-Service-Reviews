She made a lot of this is John and I'll be him.
Hi did you say John?
Yes.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yeah, this is Dave calling from the task.
Hey, uh, oh, I got a list of.
Can you hear me?
I can hear you know.
Oh, okay.
Uh, I've got a list of a vehicle and looking for a 22 to 24.
GMC Tahoe or I mean, uh, heavy Tahoe or a Yukon for a high country.
I got a specific list of details I'm looking for, which normally ends up to be the premier high country.
And I got my name on this paper and my number where I'm from in the colors I'm looking for.
But, uh, anyways, are you interested in trying to find me one of them?
I have some on the lot.
Can I send you this?
Can I text you my list?
Sure.
You have a pen and paper handy?
I certainly do.
John.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Phone.
He's free.
989.
Nah.
Nah.
Let's just see what we got going here.
I can text, text you this right away, I believe.
Okay.
And what was it that you see us on?
New.
I just looked at...
Yeah, I'm the Internet.
Sure, what's that?
I don't know. Hang on, sir. I'm trying to touch you something here.
No problem.
May I? Can't wait to help.
So, yeah, we basically just looked and I called the place in the trade area.
I called Alpino, Pierre and Soto-Boy, Trevor City, and looking for a thoughtman.
I know it's probably been a month or maybe six weeks by Italy.
But everybody's turning in the leases and stuff like that.
You know, I'm looking for a specific thing.
I found lots of things that have a 6.2.
That's why I don't really want to start looking at card on.
I don't think it's got everything I want.
But anyway, so...
I'm at least on my seat, it'll add the years.
The place I want to pay to my house is, you know, in my
checklist on there in the colors.
I don't want any dark colors.
No navy blue or that dark, that dark cherry, which looks good.
But I'm not interested.
So, did that?
I didn't know it.
I'm waiting.
Phooms.
79.
Oh, and I screwed up.
Let's try another one.
I'm not sure.
Does that a reason why it won't get it?
Probably so, you know.
All right, so.
That finger's done, Graham.
Let me have some time.
Probably happens a lot.
If there's something who working with numbers all the time, you know.
Do you want a lighter color U-Con or GMC?
You know, I'll take your Chevy or a Denali.
You know, whatever, whatever hits the specs of that.
Did you get it now?
Let's see.
All right, see, yes, I did.
So, you got to be talking to 24 premier country Denali.
Denali is going to come with a 6-2.
I'll do that.
I didn't know that they, I didn't know they come static.
I thought you could get the 5.3 in them.
I didn't know that.
Part me, they come standard with 6-2.
Yep.
Well, then.
Do you have to go to Tahoe?
Yeah.
Or it has to be an incredible deal on a Denali, but they're more expensive than it is anyways.
What price range are you at?
It says on there 58 to 58.
I'll pay a little more if it's got a little miles or a little miles to a less than, you know,
well, help.
12,000?
15,000?
I got one.
It's a late and color high country.
Again, the high country is 6-2 leader, which you don't want to hold on.
Well, not all high countries are 6-2.
Right.
Let me see.
The ones I have are 6-2.
Let me help.
Hold on.
Yeah.
Of course.
You'll have exactly what I want there to be a 6-2.
I mean, I guess it's 4 to 5 weeks if I'm not finding anything.
I may end up there, but I'm not going to start there.
I appreciate that.
I'll get an Auburn.
I'll get an Auburn.
Are you?
Good work.
So, Shane, make a lot.com and type in TAH.
I'm on.
All right.
So, go to use vehicle.
Yep.
Okay.
All right.
There should be 9 TAHWIS between the 21 and 25.
Just Chevrolet.
Yeah.
Why do I want to look at them all?
It says you got one.
One what?
One TAH.
23 TAH.
No, there's.
Are you on Shane, make a lot.com?
No.
Uh, megal.
That's all I need the same damn thing.
Obviously not.
Yeah.
All right.
Now I am.
I'm going to type in TAHWIS on the search bar after you go to pre-owned.
I'm obviously doing something wrong.
Free-owned.
Search for inventory.
You type in TAHWIS.
No, I did.
Yeah.
I see.
I see.
All right.
So, I come seeing.
All right.
Yep.
So, we got those high-country there's their low miles.
Two-way wind black one.
All right.
So, yeah.
No.
I mean, that's like $12,000 more.
Not $2,000 more.
Okay.
And then if you scroll down, there's another last RST, Z71.
Uh, you know, it only pops up with three.
Next carrier.
It says, black.
I don't know.
Would you never get a black.
I get clicked on the high country.
23 to 25.
Let's go to 22 maybe.
That's the fault of there.
That's that done.
2021 to 2025.
Year.
Okay.
Thank you.
Well, features do you need?
What I want is what I sense you.
So, I guess that's what I need.
I'm not delaying it.
I'm not deleting anything in that list.
I gave you.
That's why I made the list.
And I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm not necessarily trying to eliminate anything, not on this place of vehicle that I want.
So, nothing.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
And I don't want a white vehicle.
If it's that pearlized tri-coat, I would take that.
Yeah.
No, no, no white.
I'm a old guy.
I'd like to see that metal plate.
Season, season.
Well, there we go.
Down like that.
There we go.
Season.
So, I've got to have me some metal flake or that pearlized tri-coat will do.
That's pretty sweet looking to.
Even though that's probably at the bottom of what I want, I know they charge you nice
to grand for it.
It wouldn't be my first day.
But it's better than a black one, better than a navy blue one, better than a dark bird
anyone.
But, you know.
And I may get there.
You know what?
I weighed a month and no one's popping up with anything.
Maybe I'll add one more color.
Which would probably be that dark bird in the wine instead of a navy blue.
But I'm not there.
Sure.
Well, David, can you just get disconnected here?
What's a good number for you?
The one I'm talking to you on is this one.
So, it's on there.
See.
Zero six.
Got it.
A radar rate and then what's the last name, David?
It's on there, feet with my phone number and everything.
I checked it today.
Yeah.
Just so you don't need to be certain.
You're just where I can't accuse you of this balance.
It needs go to needs got to needs go to need go to
Yeah, so the thing is is we're a high volume dealer so we've filled over 300 units
a month in a month out.
So what you see today probably won't be here when you're ready.
The other hand we will have more.
I'm never coming back to the site.
I guess I misunderstood me you might have misunderstood me.
I'm thinking you're looking for the vehicle.
I won't be back on this site looking for vehicles.
That that would mean I'd be looking at 30 different dealerships for vehicles.
That's why I called you someone who's going to make money selling me a vehicle.
I'm I'm passing that but time to you.
And that's fine if you don't want to look for it.
Let me know now and I'll call another dealer.
Yeah, I appreciate that.
I'm just sure.
But I'm just telling you, you know, our history here.
So you know how fast our inventory goes.
So if I do call you and there is something that's available that fits your parameters,
you might want to, you know, see what we can do to get you in it.
Well, I am very high rated credit person.
So I don't believe there's no be any issues with that.
And OK, and I already have my long line up to the credit in so I'm ready to go.
You know, I don't know if I can make a deal in two days, but certainly I can tell you
I'm doing a deal in one day.
I'm sure.
Oh, no, obviously you're calling around.
You're declaring, you know, I can appreciate that.
And I appreciate the opportunity to see what we can do to earn your business here at say,
Megalot.
So, but yeah, no for sure.
And our late days, so you know, are Mondays and Thursdays.
And then I don't know what your schedule is, but we are open on Saturday from nine to four
as well.
Well, if you text me all that would be good.
You need to call from potassium John.
So I won't be coming down.
Right?
OK, so we'd be shipping it to you.
Well, no, I could drive down and get that.
You're talking 200 miles.
It's sure.
I found a couple of these in Indiana Ohio already.
And one of them is 400, 400 miles away.
And I, it's a certified one.
It's red.
It's got everything that I asked for.
Lower miles.
It's got the 28,000 miles of fill in the world.
These certified got the additional certified, you know, the certified warranty for 12 months,
you know, 12,000 miles.
So they're out there.
And I talked to them and I'm just trying to find some someplace closer.
Right?
I drive 150 miles and 400 if you get my drift.
No, absolutely.
I'll be alone.
That's doing the same thing.
So I was using right.
Right.
And so I drive down.
I've got friends and family and deer born in Allen Park area.
So I drive down the highway after I'm right through plants.
So, you know, this seems like a good idea for someone to make money and plant if you
can find it.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'll keep my eyes out.
Yeah.
And like I said, our inventory changes quite a bit.
So yeah, I mean, that's something that that could very welcome across here.
And then we can see what we can do.
No, are you trading anything in there?
No.
Okay.
No.
No.
No.
No.
And I got a 5.5% loan.
You know, I'm a, I'm only financing half of it anyway.
So I don't think you're going to hit 5.5, but maybe you can.
Who's your, who's your credit union?
Same Francis credit.
Okay.
All right.
So what's your, what's your rate right now?
Well, we may be able, now you see you're only financing half.
So are you only going for a certain amount of time?
I'm trying to get the cheapest amount monthly possible.
So the longest period I can get.
So how long is this 5.5?
Or that's seven years.
Okay.
All right.
And then I quite sure.
So when the time comes, I could definitely see what we can do to either match or beat it.
And because we're dealing with direct, I mean, we're not deal with the same Francis that
I'm aware of, but we are dealing with the majority of the lenders in the state.
Yeah.
That'll be fine.
And you know, so, ideally, I didn't have the time I left if you're getting something
I'm hoping it's certified.
Right.
So especially on a lease back, it would, I mean, it wouldn't be exciting to be certified.
Sure.
So with us, we have what's called car Bravo certified.
And that's a six months or 6,000 miles of factory coverage.
I've added on to the remainder of what's left from the factory.
And that's fine.
I can use that up here.
I got the dealership up here in past.
You're looking for the vehicle too.
Yep.
That's no problem.
So yeah, so I'll keep my eyes out and I got what you need here.
Again, my name is John Ledesma.
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
You've got my cell number there.
And then we can go from there.
All right.
Well, I'm hoping to hear from you.
I won't have any questions, John.
I'm waiting for the successful hunter.
Oh, yeah.
All right, Dave.
Well, then we'll see what we can do if I can find you some.
I'll be in touch.
I'll put the feelers out there as well.
We've got people going to the auction all the time.
And, and or, you know, for these turning comes in even better yet.
Yeah, even better yet.
Now, auctions are sketchy.
Right.
They're at an auction for a real.
For a real.
Then this is, then this is fairly.
We've got some pretty good inventory from the auction.
And the owner here is very particular
rewarding purchases at the auction just because we do a high volume here.
And the last thing we want to do is offer, you know, bad product to our customers.
Yeah.
OK.
Well, John, that's hopefully we'll be talking to you soon.
That'll be great.
Yes, sir.
I appreciate the opportunity.
I'll be I'll be in touch here.
I'll follow back up with you here in a few days.
Let you know.
I'll be there following something or I'm still looking.
Nice.
Sounds good.
I appreciate you, John.
Have a good.
Have a good.
Have a good.
A little bit.
