The the east west.
Right.
Living ring.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
So I got with my.
I knew you at work.
So I was going to text you.
So I got with my, my sales manager on that one.
He said it would be best for you to stay around the 30 to 25,000.
Okay.
Okay.
So I'm.
Okay.
Okay.
So, um,
did he say it would go through or.
I would have to do a real credit app with you.
Okay.
So,
there is a message you're seeing this is that I work under the table.
And then I work at Sam's and then I start drawing.
I start to stay around five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five.
Okay.
But now I think.
I don't think I want to go to the other one.
I started thinking about that.
And that's just a sign I shouldn't.
So let me just say with this one because I'm wanting to.
Fix my house and get back in it.
And I'll cut you a couple of years to do that.
So let me just say with the 39.
I like that one.
Okay.
The one that the East West, the one you originally acquired on.
That might be the same one.
I like that one when I,
it was the last one you sent for 30.
Not the last one, but the one before the.
Where did you say call that one residential one?
I don't want that one because it, it was a law.
I'm sorry.
You talking about the 2021?
I'm not sure what your model it was.
I know you it was the only one you sent me that was 39.
Okay.
Yeah.
I can go to a state without one.
Yeah.
Let me stick with that one.
Okay.
You capable of doing a credit off with me or.
Oh, goodness.
I'm so scared.
I'm not going to get it.
What would stop me from getting it?
Really?
Just just credit.
I know one of them came back as I think he I think was around 580.
Six.
One else.
The five.
I score is my five.
I score is 642.
Are you able to put any kind of money down like even can you do a thousand?
I can.
I can't do it this week.
No.
I don't have to do it maybe next.
That.
the first of the month.
Okay.
So you can do it.
Okay.
Let me.
Let me just try and see if we can get you done with no money down.
Well, if you don't think you can, I don't want to run it because I don't want to lower my credit anymore.
My pocket score for my pocket score 642.
And I don't really want to lower that.
So if you don't think you can.
Well, let me do this.
Let me get my finance manager and have him look at it.
Okay.
But I'll just let you know I work my money don't show but I start growing my first
security first security jet.
Step 10 of the first.
And then I work under the table and I make like I make good and then I work with Sam's.
I just started with Sam's.
You wouldn't be able to do that.
I did pretty good huh?
You wouldn't be.
I'm sorry.
I'm correct.
I can.
Well, they call me up here in Lake Park.
I really didn't have to prove that.
I mean, I could let somebody sign a you know, go and let or state me that I do work for them.
You know, and then Sam's you know, I mean, it's I just started so I've only got one check.
Then and I'll get another one this coming up week.
So I can prove that and then I'm so straight check.
I mean, that's just, you know, that's gonna be I mean, you could probably run that and look
at that through the things.
Because I'm gonna start getting in on her.
I guess they'll fit it on my time card.
But I've already got it set up with it on my time card.
Very well.
We can do.
I'll do the credit up with you and have my finance manager take a look at it.
She won't stop me and you're credit.
And then we'll go from there because I know you're at work.
Uh huh.
Trying to if we're able to get you done on this one.
Okay.
Let me see.
Yeah.
Cause I'll tell them I'll tell them if you don't think we're able to get it done.

I get my face through this statement first and September.
Okay.
So what's your employer's name?
Um, what I work on her.
the one that I work for is Rebecca Carter.
That's an aim of the place.
I know now that I work at a, I work under the table.
That was one of my jobs.
And the other one, I'm sorry.
The other one, I work at Sam.
Are you going to believe me?
I'm okay.
So I'm like, here, give me where you were carrying a rat.

Yes.
That's every week.
That's what my opinion you leave.
Okay.
It's like for the month.
And then I work at SAMs and I make 16 dollars an hour there.
And so I guess I'll make, I'll think I make like, I probably make about two minutes
a year or two thousand a month there.
And then when I get my sales to check, I'll be making 13th, 20 there.
For example, how do you leave like working on like four,
because you're just on by the line for you?

I spent over a year, because I'm one man that did that we had passed away.
So and I was with him.
Yeah, about two years.
I've been doing this forever.
I got you.
And then you don't know the address at all is in near your house.
I know it's an equals county.
It's like about.
It's probably about 20 minutes from 90 or 10 minutes from my house.
And you don't have the address at all.
I don't.
I know that sounds crazy, but I don't.
I'm them even.
But I can spell that back year later on because it's probably on my trip that she gives me.
