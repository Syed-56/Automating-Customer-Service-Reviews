Darryl water at the GMC. How can I help you? Yes, all right. Can I speak to a
Sales person, please? Yeah, give me one second. Let me grab somebody for you. You could all come up. I call one
I turn my name is Joey Pajola
You
Hey, Joe thank you for holding Alexander List here at Walter view again, are you available to drop on by today?
I am available, but I just have some questions before that
Okay, I would get
For 88
Okay, you're trying to I just thought this driver drop off your vehicle. You said no, no, no actually
I want to lease a vehicle
I'm a different dealership has it
But they're not for some reason they're not willing to
lease a car to me and I want to make sure that I'm not gonna have the same problem here
But what they did say was they can send that car to any dealership in the nation
Okay, I want to explain to you so that you can find out is this
There I would be some vehicle
I need to be so vehicle for two years
Okay, I am licensed and I am a resident of California
But my businesses are in Tennessee and Georgia
So there's no reason what they couldn't
We call it least a cost in my business
Because they both of them have physical addresses in each state that is registered to do business legally in
And it's also being personally guaranteed
And so for some reason they just said they weren't willing to do it
Even though it's 100% possible. There's no reason why they can't do it
So I'm just asking you if you guys are gonna have a problem with that as well
There are some variables
May not be a problem per se, but we may have
Some steps that are added to the process depending on where we're registering the vehicle
So your current ballot license is from the state of California
Yeah, I'm buying it through my business
I'm leasing it through my business
My drug the business is registered in Tennessee as well as Georgia and California
I could do it here
If you're paying title to everything here in the citizen of C. I don't I don't need it to be California
Typically we'll have
insurance
What was that?
Typically with that process the lenders want the vehicle to be registered to the same address as
Where your license is held
Yeah
I'm business is not necessary
Correct not saying it'll it'll distract for me anything. Just hold that we're not
Getting off you know to a rough start or later down the line
Here's this kid bit that I could have addressed early on that now becomes a bigger problem to notice work
Yeah, well, this is why I want to explain it all to you so you can let me know
If this is the problem in us before we proceed with the rest of the situation
Which is
Getting the contrast for to to your dealership, correct
These do you have a stock number on the vehicle that
We're working toward or looking forward
Yeah, yeah, so there also wants to check on the price because
With them it was the least for two years 10,000 miles
And it was
$311 a month was the least
And one second because I have the information here
It was from the
Dallas Georgia
The Harvey's GMC. Do it things so I think get more information from them
but I asked him if the prices can be the same and
And he said
That I got stuff to the dealerships like well, why would it be different? It's like you got a sauce of it. I was like, okay
So what's the anywhere make a lot of never
Yeah, this is a 2024
Sierra
504 wheel drive
the stock number is
L
40658
Yeah, just a moment here
In honestly, I don't have to buy it through the business or anything like that
I just want to be able to get it. I do have a apartment here in Franklin Tennessee
Unzarname and everything is just my license. There's not a Tennessee license
It's written pose as much of a problem. I can't forecast for for
See everything that you will
Be able to go through
until we get started
So it does be
Sierra 1500 have to be black
Are you open on that? I just I just want it to be the right price
So this particular one the least would have been three hundred and eleven dollars
essentially this is the
Qualifier for a number of leasing specials
There's combo with the 2.7 liter high
high output turbo max
Being a a Sierra 1500
I
If I can't get that that price you have a leave. I think it's quite close just depends on
We qualify for what we can put together
That these days with the junior
It's a lease well you can get that when I know that this is possible
I'm not gonna go in there for hours trying to figure out numbers. I just want to go sign and leave you know what I mean
So what's it? I just want to do email address for you
I can send some preliminary documents your way as far as getting a finance application
We can get a copy of your life. I'm not financing this car. I'm just leasing it if you are leasing the vehicle
It still applies to your credit there
One way or another
We would have to complete our finance application Joe
Yeah
I
There's so many variables. I think some of you can do it and then I'll do it. I'm not gonna get are you gonna do a soft pool or hard inquiry?
And yes, it'll be a soft pool
Okay, soft
Much rather work this out with you here that way you can see everything that's happening. There's no chatter back
Dude, I am so not going to do this in person. I just need to know that you could do
That deal give you a number and then we're done. You know what I mean then I go in sign and we're out of it
I'm not gonna. Okay. Joe. You're doing something for it
You're doing it
Okay, yes, I am often are you committing to a client that doesn't give you anything I
Can send you a number of different things
You give numbers in my business
No need to shout. Oh my god. I can send you I can send you a number of proposals a number of links a number of things
But I would need a commitment for you. I could give you a
Sure fire. Yes, and then you hit here. It's not possible. That would that would upset you. I don't
Accommodation here. Oh my gosh
Oh my gosh, I'm the easiest person to deal with when it comes to business and sales because I'm even trying to haggle
I want to know the price
Yeah, that says yes, can you do it with that presented the problem that we can overcome?
You think it won't be a problem the second thing we need to know is the price
I'm not gonna go in you say hey, but that's I can do for Lisa's filing the bus
When I'm here you're loving
You're
on a 24 GMC's year 1500 SLB double cab four will drive pickup that is located in Dallas, Georgia
I'm in Franklin, Tennessee. I don't have 24s on my lot
I'm asking qualifying questions. You could be a class be black
You want a certain number on the
In order to leave there are certain qualifiers that you have to hit to get a low payment $300
In this truck is probably retailing for roughly mid 40s about 50 grand out the door
There are a number of things that are going to detract and make a change on that monthly payment
So if I say yes, I can achieve that payment you get here is way higher
How were you going to feel?
Like I didn't do my diligence up front. That's what I'm attempting to do to save us time being easy
Don't if being easy with business is
Sending information to you in which I can do getting some information to you which is what I'm gonna need
I think that's it information
I can get your here to be I don't always do Travis time right I went to the
They got the car they made plans they got the car everything was great
We worked out the price they did us off on the credit and everything like what?
Middle-y I was ready to go and pick up this car
Right and then they said well because you don't have a Georgia job is licensed. We can give it to you
I'm like and then we find work around right, but they will have my business in Georgia's license says. Oh, I've got to work
Then it comes back with well
Whatever whatever and then in the end there's no reason why we searched this
And there's no reason why they can't give me the car other things is commercial
insurance for the business in this particular state
Everything was fine. I have a physical address there and everything
If I try to explain the hurdles so that with you
I'm giving you a commercial front that they didn't have because it just happened through the process in the end
There's no reason why they can do this for me. They just thought well
It give me the car and then there's a problem with title and they don't give it to us
You have a car right and so it's like in the end. It was just been not sure if they could do it
But if I never done right and so so then if you're comfortable, so they say you know what
Go to another dealership that can handle this and do this and we'll give them the car
And that's why I called one here which is how I got to hold the view
Because they can transfer the car to you so all I'm trying to make sure is
I'm not going to see a problem with you that I have with Dan that they're winning you to the car because I don't have a
Georgia's driver's license. I mean the in this case a Tennessee driver's license
It shouldn't be a problem. What's it mean?
Um, yeah, that's not a problem. If that's not a problem, then that's great
Um, the question is do I need to do it under the business or can it be done personally the lease?
The thing one which you which you would like to do if you want to go down in the business sure okay
I don't care I really don't have hard
Okay, I don't care. I don't care
Yeah, so so you're saying that you're confident that even though I have a California driver's license and I don't live here
Permanently, I know a point of resume Tennessee
You will feel
Okay, that's okay. I'm just saying that that's the first hurdle
So now my next question is price
That would be the next thing so if you can do that have to look into yes, sir. I would have to look at any
First of all, let me explain something about the trust if you were asking me it doesn't have to be black
Right, but it has to be four-wheel-drive
We do want the short box
And obviously a four-door truck. There's a zero 1500 so it doesn't even have to be a 2024
The only thing I know is a 20 turn four is done the cheaper ones
For the lease and this particular place has it which they can bring to you and
Even though online it was advertised at two or eight a month
I could get only put the taxes and stuff to it so then it came up to three eleven of that particular dealership and I'm fine
Clean the three eleven correct on fine thing the three eleven. It was a down payment
which they do accept the down payment with the credit card
and
And that's how it went down, but then the end they just didn't feel comfortable
We're you're saying exactly so for use not a problem. It doesn't have to be exact truck
But that's the truck they had the price that we wanted to pay
So then if you can confirm that information
I have no problems giving you you prefer the double cap or would you want the full-size door crew cap where you have more space in the back row
I'm you know, I'm not looking for
Honestly, it's two people in the truck most of the time
I just know that we like the shorter ones because we don't want it to be difficult to park
Okay
That's really this is as far as they interior we don't care as long as it has a short bed. It's comfortable
It could be a four door could be a longer. It doesn't matter. I've never seen them long doors. I'm using four doors to be honest, but
And then it depends on the lease that fall and it's only a two-year lease
We want 10,000 miles or even last if they do less, but I think 10,000s at low as you get go
It's very rare most people probably driving a little more so it
It exists there are banks that will pick it up, but it actually would make much of a different population
Okay, that's fine 10,000 will be the number that I chose online
Consensus, you know the only incentive. I know we have is that we currently own a GMC
But it's not a lease and it's like a 20 21 model
Okay, that
And then and that's fine so what will be the next step then because I don't I just said I don't mind give you for me
Just one only gonna get closer to three hundred dollar lease amount
And trust to your pick what is that one?
Okay, so the last name
For the person is going to personally guarantee this this loan is Roberts
He'll be the one picking up and everything too. I'm just making the call to get this under business owner
But he's the one that's gonna be doing it
With Robert
as Roberts are
I mean your last name is Roberts
The person that you're gonna be working with and doing all this with the person you put a credit for his image
Robert
What's the first name for the season?
It's even but it's a pH though because even with peach. I got you
So it's even Roberts
You just a moment here. That was a little bit of a curve
I want to make sure I have your contact information and I want to get that
That's fine tied up with a Stevens
Not a problem. Okay
pH
Okay
Uh
Email address with add be for you or give you all of his information. So I'm gonna give it a go right now that way in the end
Let me see
And what's the name of the business?
Well again if you could just first thing doesn't matter by the name of the business
Do you want it or or
From not my take that way. I'm aware of which you guys have going on
I've been sleeping commercial here as well. So if you are growing your fleet or
I can watch my business managers to kind of help put all this together
Okay, well the name of the business to answer your questions is x1
The letter x the number one capital partners
LLC
That is registered in Tennessee
Okay, I do have the the
Take it through saying all that documentation
Jiff Coer
The zip code you said? Yeah
One second
I'm throwing a letter to you. I get it
No, it's fine. I just trying to see
And I'm in the car
I'll do it
Zip code
Three seven zero six four
What's the you guys are around a corner?
The Berry Fines is uh where we're renting an apartment
I
Bafines crossing. I don't know if you know right area. Yeah, uh over in Britain. We're frankly we're right off of uh
I 65. I just 65 so that's what I was referring to you ever around the corner. Okay. We're nearly neighbors
But let me let me put up the email address as well for speeds
It is are you ready for his email?
Yes, sir
Dot com
Okay, and uh
As far as a contact number
Is there contact number for Stephen or are we sticking with your serious?
um
Well, it's okay to speak with Stephen directly in the end up by God the way regardless
But I'm the owner of the business and my business partner and
We're trying to draw this please. I'm going to have personally guarantee and keep the car and the least if he's here
But nonetheless, let me give you a his phone number
um
I
Seven
correct
Okay, and that email address
That's correct. Okay, and when are we anticipating?
Picking this one up you guys. I'd like to rock a road get through it today. Oh, yeah, we could do it today
Okay, there will be perfect if we get the right numbers right so
I'll tell you
10,000 years go for 24 months. We're hopeful for around
3 10 3 15 ish
correct
For for
Short bed not necessarily a double cab I got you
You did you know and also yeah in the down payment for that for that was
I mean look at this again
Does I could pay it
I might just decide not to pay it and just go with the higher lease amount, but
Give me one second here
Because that's always the trade-off right or the higher lease or lower payments
Because if you want to say hey, Joe, you could just three for teen with
5,000 down right
um
It was 5500 down
Okay, but if you want to say
You know it is a 3 15 with 50,000 down or
It'll be 500 with no money down
But you know something like that then obviously I probably just go for the higher lease amount
No, no, the money down is it's a thing trail right paid more money now or just pay more for 24 months. Yeah
Sometimes where did the change your money up right you just paid a little bit extra
Yeah, so so that's not the only thing so once you give me the numbers
Then I can meet that decision whether we go with no money down, but we just
Put something down
I'm guessing
So you can work out then if you want yeah with no money down
Go ahead Joe
I was just gonna say how long would it be before you give me an idea of what?
The lease will be
Probably 45 minutes to an hour
So I give this my business manager's I see that they're
pile-on right now, but
Once they break out of the meeting
The opportunity to talk and figure out
Will work probably following up with you
Okay, so that's good. Don't you reason is I'm leaving town tonight
So that I want to make sure that if this is gonna happen we can do it. I know my family and I bet so
Yeah, I'm
Scares within till 3 p.m. likely not getting out of here in 2006, but I like to get home and see my family
