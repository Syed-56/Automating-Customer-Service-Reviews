Hello, I was calling the back to you guys, wholesale this weekend.
So are you all just my is a $79 cash card by just buy out or is it down painting for mostly painting?
All three. We have a certain amount of colors that are going to be $79 for the entire vehicle.
And then of course we have a retail where we can get some people down with $79 down or $79 a month.
Okay.
All right. And what time is that starting?
So registration starts at eight. The gates open at nine.
But I've had personally myself, never mind all the other probably 20 salespeople and all of them.
I've had three people already saying that they're coming tonight when we close and they're going to basically spend the night out front.
Oh, wow. Yeah.
We expect three to four-polar people.
It's definitely going to be in huge advantage.
There's going to be a lot of people spending the night and doing everything they can.
Basically, you get a car. So it's going to be very reserved.
Okay.
Okay.
All right. And some of the cars don't have clean titles.

I think the majority of them are going to have. I don't think we're going to sell anything that doesn't have a clean title.
Okay.
All right. And you say, yeah, the gates open at eight.
Registration starts at eight. The gates open at nine.
