You know, just until family-owned and operated dealers in 1978.
Erlington told you, it was tough.
Thank you for all my little board, please tell us what happened to the doctor.
I'm for still-ups.
And what you're like doing.
Blush on me, Jason.
Thank you.
I'm just calling actually to find out what you're ready to start your interest rate
off a new car.
I wish your longest finance period for a new car.
How many months?
Well, that is going to vary very, very interesting question,
but that is up to the bank now.
Regular loans when it's coming to a financing is 72, 75.
When it's coming to Southeast America,
but I'm not going to be able to say,
what is exactly going to be the rate on till the bank say,
I don't have any tool that it gives me that information.
That is up on the credit, up on the structure of the deal.
What are you putting just in every single car?
And then you're going to be from the program that has been made.
Oh, sorry.
It could be.
Oh, that is.
Oh, okay.
Well, that would have just been called out a little bit.
I'm not even sure.
And they may be getting one,
but I'm not sure.
I went to the bank and they could get a printout.
And our favorite list is rates is highest,
less than second percent on the dollar.
No, no, no.
Yes.
The longer they give you, it was what a new car or a huge.
I didn't talk.
I just got paperwork.
I just asked paperwork about the rates going late.
And they're just getting a printout of what it was.
And so,
the bank's advice.
And that is what the bank is saying, right?
Right.
So obviously it's as weird.
Yeah, I'm not very good.
Go ahead.
No, I'm not.
I'm not.
Then you guys used to finance.
I mean,
I know a long time ago before it got crazy.
Like it is down.
You would have like zero interest.
So many months.
This.
I understand.
And they don't do stuff like that.
No more because I don't think I've seen that in a minute.
So having this curious.
I guess I've probably had to end up at about to see what they say.
And go from there.
Well, this is one thing that I can,
that I can mind tell you.
Okay.
If you're going in a brand new car,
okay, that ban on what is the need will be looking forward.
So I'll be still in the good way to do.
Now, the problem is I cannot promise which one cannot say it
because I don't know what's how you're looking to defend your cars.
That is opposite.
And the bank's bought so many times customer that we have.
Okay.
They're coming with buy sir.
Many of them they switch with our own finance.
They're big.
They have so many hundred.
But sometimes somebody's better.
So you order bank's will marry God.
They stir.
TD bank.
It just is many people and then just but it's going to be
dependent.
The car has been the credit profile.
So it's a little hard now.
What I know in fact is a lot of the customers,
they come to buy some but they actually need it.
A people and our lenders.
Well, that's why I call it new because I'm doing some credit.
Consider just stopping.
Is I making my.
I'm reading right now.
It's over 800 my credit scores over 800 it dropped at one point from
853 to like maybe 810 or something I've had.
I don't know why.
But I'm.
Oh, you're going to be good.
I don't know.
You're going to be good.
You know, the issue is way.
Is.
Okay, this is some of you come here and you said,
oh, we're done.
I want a camera.
Corolla.
Whatever is the car that you're looking for.
Well, we have the big.
So we have we just.
We know about.
So then we can help you.
To avoid that.
You know, that all the time to go bank into bank into bank.
And then we help you to get into the best sign up because
I've been there today better plan that the food is better.
It's better for us as well.
So if we went for both, you can you can go with the bank.
You want to be.
No, I had to go in after something so I just inquire because.
I'm almost through half of my house.
And the next month I'll be through a path on our home.
And I say, if I have to get a car because.
you know, that's what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking, what's up for the God.
I don't.
But if I do, I'm just trying to get some ideas of you know,
where to go.
Where to start.
And in my credit rating.
I'm not worried about.
Um.
My house.
I'm only fine here.
But I paid.
And that was like 5 years and 9 months.
So I'm not worried about that.
Even though it's like, I'm not good.
A word about the answer is great to find out that I'm
I'm going to be on.
That's what I did.
So, you know, so.
Yeah.
I was just curious.
Okay.
Well, maybe if you move forward or if you're not in the adhesive question, please just call
me.
Okay.
My name is for bird's human.
And it's going to be not going to be a pleasure for me to try to help as far as I can.
Or any different aspect of any direction.
Okay.
Can I ask your question?
You don't take a personal?
100%.
Are you Hispanic?
Because my father is.
Yes, I do.
Okay.
Well, my, my last name is Spanish.
I went back into my main name is Pepliss, but I don't speak Spanish.
And probably wrong my father.
He was, his family was born in Havana, but he was actually born in Saint-Dauber.
All this stuff that's going on.
He was born in Cuba, Florida.
But he grew up in Vancouver.
Yeah, he grew up in Cuba out there.
Mom has.
But I could tell my your accent that you're not American.
And a lot of people say my father sounded funny or different.
But I'm like, I just because I grew up hearing his voice.
He sounded like you and I.
I didn't know he sounds like everybody else.
But I didn't hear the accent because my ears were trained to his voice.
Yeah.
You know, so.
You know, I'm like, I don't.
Why you sound like that?
I'm like, how did you sound?
It was like, you sound.
I'm like, well, you sound.
He sound like you were.
And you know, I couldn't tell the difference.
Because I grew up hearing his voice.
So, but I'm just hearing you.
So you're Mona, you say?
Yes, oh, Burchin.
Like, what Burchin without the R.
Oh, Burchin.
Right.
Mona.
Mona.
Mona.
And you.
It was even something like that.
Yes.
I don't know.
Yeah.
And you and only.
You got to just write perfect.
Okay.
Well, um, go further.
If and when I take the chance to make this next step, if I'm forced to, I will probably come up and say,
what are the goals?
Okay.
I'm just thinking it's going to be this because I know all cars went up tremendously.
What is the going price for a new, um, what is the small SUV right now?
We have a girl across and we have rap force.
That is the day entry level as far as that SUV.
So you can go and across.
It's going to be the best.
Some of them, they have a little eye on the meat 20.
Some of them load 30.
So there's going to be the 10.
But just take a look at them.
And if you make or hopefully not forced, somebody here need a vehicle just running out.
It's got to be a pleasure for me.
You coming here.
I'll show you both of them because they are different sizes.
I just want to make sure you had the right.
I don't want to.
I don't want a super large car.
I'm sure.
And I can't see.
I mean, I'm in a rental vehicle right now.
But it's like, and they put in an SUV with them.
I don't know that I'm right.
I like, you know, because I can't think of some more strategies in the car.
You can't lay that little panel flat to see over it.
They're the SUV.
I mean, I love board.
And whatever it is, you can't put it down.
And I'm right.
It's a destruction.
So, um, I would have to come here.
Yeah.
I got a good feeling.
Corona Cross is going to be a good.
You give me the height and you give you a nice belt.
You're not going to feel overwhelmed with the rest.
So that is to be a very good option for look up.
Okay.
Okay.
Can you give me a go in price for a new one with this?
Um, you know, maybe I'm on a 20 inch something like that.
Oh, sorry.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't see that.
Can we do like 32 of them change?
So why would a camera call is more than an SUV?
Yes.
That's the car.
Yeah.
Well, I cross the engine level.
I should be into your line.
Can you have, can we?
Then you have a rap board.
That is the going.
For roller cross, can we rap for?
That is a one to four.
Well, I've got a camera now.
I've been in a camera now since old earthy.
Well, the thing is, you know, can you not be there?
Yeah.
You're not the camera.
Level.
So many people you think with the rap board or the roller cross because they hide.
So, you know, sometimes they'll be the hardest, you know, and they can read a little
tool.
You think to the ground and they want something to live with.
I think it's going to be higher to be more comfortable.
I want something high because I just told the front end pretty much off my car because
I've probably known that.
So it was a camera, but it was like, you know, it was a lot of help they have in the parking lot.
They had one of them hide it in normal.
It was concrete.
My right over it finally gets back.
It told my bumper all.
I just got it.
So you might.
I don't know.
But I think for my car, there was more than else.
It was right.
So I'm a half a good show.
So you know, you're way going over.
And you got my name.
I will have a few hours for a second.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, brother, Molo, Molo, Molo, Molo, Molo.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm right.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
