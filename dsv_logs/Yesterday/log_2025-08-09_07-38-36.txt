This is J.B. for Man-I-Hunde who would have the pleasure speaking with.
Hi, dude.
Hi, how can I help you?
Yeah.
I'm going to just a second.
Because my head is going to ask me to call you just a second.
Okay.
Okay.
So he is looking for a nice, lucky car.
And he, with the heel-dice testing, he got a deal there.
But we are looking if you have an opportunity to get a better deal.
Let me tell you what I got.
We got the model, he only took five.
R-W-D-S-E-L.
And the 20, 25 years, 20, 25.
I had the V-number in case you want to look it up.
But the deal he's showing me here in the tape of the day was 36 months,
and he's going to be $349.39.
And it's $3,449.
And it's $3,aded.
And it shows there was $12,26,076.
It was saying the market price was $51.51.
And then the G-Z's dealer discount of rebates.
And the vehicle is showing here after the rebate to $32,000.
So anyway, what I want to talk about is the lease.
Because the lease now for 36 months is $349.
And I was interested in knowing if you might have, you know,
at least another car that would be lower than this.
Because we want to be below $300.
This is our budget.
But we are willing to go a little bit up.
But, you know, we want to be as close as possible to our budget.
So that's why I'm calling you to see, because in case you have,
my husband is going to go to you tonight and make this deal happen.
Because we need to be able to come right away
if I tell you, like, if we can do it or get somewhere close.
Yeah.
Because he was going to get this car tonight.
And then he went to the testing first because it's close by our house.
And I also have the policy.
So we already know, like, the Hyundai.
And we like the Hyundai.
So he was looking for a electric.
So between all the options in the market,
he was like, OK, let me go to Hyundai first.
Because since we already have the policy.
So then he went to the testing and then he got this deal.
And then he was like, you call the Anaheim high because he said,
they have something better.
I just should going to drive to them and make a big deal there.
OK.
But are you sure he won't, like, take our number and call somewhere else and try to get lower?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
Because that's the price.
That's what the first thing J.
To them.
Like, they say that's the best they can give.
you.
So I think that the only car they had for that they could be, you know, this price.
So if you have something else, I don't think it would.
You know, if it's your deal, I don't think it would go over anything.
Yeah.
So I think we will.
This is I think we're able to get close.
Right?
But we can't give you an exact number because we don't have any information.
But I could tell you right now that we can get close.
Maybe even be it or match it.
Because we all buy the cars for the same price.
Yeah.
So if you're willing to come like as soon as possible, since we're close to eight, if you're
willing to come as soon as possible, we'll be able to finalize it for you.
But I know it can be close.
I just can't tell you an exact number because I have no information.
Yeah.
No, I understand.
It's just that it's hard for us to, like, let's say it goes to you and then you gave, you
know, maybe I don't know, even the same or $5.
You know, it's also his time.
That's what I was going to see.
Like, I know it's hard.
I understand your position and it's hard for us to.
Any amount of lower than this would be, you know, great option for us.
Is that right now the car that he got?
It's a light one.
It's Apple is white.
And it's saying they have the carpet floors, cargo mat, and the first eight feet, which
for us is okay.
It doesn't, you know, it's not a big deal.
But I don't, you know, maybe you have something similar with a lower amount because that's
maybe have less package on or I don't know.
But, you know, it's hard for us to, like, you hit drive, it should you.
And then it'll be the same price, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
We'll have a idea of an amount today.
I mean, it's happened before, but I can't, like, guarantee, like, that's what we can
get you because I don't know anything.
Like, the tax rates, the credit, I don't assume it's variables, but I know it's happened
before.
Yeah.
All right.
I'm going to call him and see if he's willing to drive to Anaheim.
And then maybe get there before eight.
I'm going to, I'm going to see because I don't know if he's willing.
That's why he's asking me to call, you know, to make sure that we have it because if we,
we do have it, you know, let's say you say, yeah, if we have a car and then we can make
it for $350, let's say, then I would tell him, hey, you know, $ reunited lives just to go
to Anaheim and make the deal.
So that's basically it's a bad.
Okay.
We can't, let me, would you let me ask, like, real quick?
Yeah.
Because I'm going to, I mean, off my knowledge, I say it's possible, but let me double check
so you don't drive all the way down here.
Yeah.
All right.
Just stay on the line real quick.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hello.
Yes.
Okay.
So I talked with Ross, my manager said, just come down here with that paper, right?
With the paper that he's got from a test in Hyundai, come down here and we'll be able to
work something out.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm telling him right now, let's see what he wants to do.
I'm texting him right now because I don't know if he will arrive there, you know, I can
find.
And I know he wanted this card this night.
I know that.
So I don't know what he wants to do.
I'm going to tell him.
It doesn't color matter as much because there's certain deals that we can get on, you know,
like certain colors.
So because of the date that we bought them, does it color matter as much?
Like what were they top three colors?
He's first option would be white.
Okay.
And then probably, probably great, but I don't think the black would be the first option,
but why could it be the first option?
And then one more color.
One more color option.
Just so I can have a ring.
Yeah, black then.
Yeah.
And then black and green.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not our favorite, but yeah.
Yeah, black and curious.
Yeah, but outside of his favorite white, then second grade.
And then black.
And then maybe blue, you know, for us.
And I don't know.
Okay.
And then before we hang up, just let me know what time you can bring that paper in.
And then let me know what time you can come here so I can schedule an appointment fill my team.
Because there's a lot of people, like let's say you come.
There's a lot of people that have to stay.
So I have to let them know that that like I have the people that watch the car, that detail the car, that we condition the car, make sure everything's fine, inspect it.
And they all have to stay.
So I need an appointment so I can over the phone right now.
So I can let them know that they can stay.
That's it.
I see.
Let me, what's your name?
A JB.
The letter is JB.
JB.
I'm, I'm putting here on the message.
JB.
Okay.
All right.
I text him.
I don't know if you're going to be able to go on your asking right now, but he have an answer yet.
Okay.
That's a possibility if he goes, maybe like in 30 minutes, but I don't know where he is exactly now.
So I'm not 100% sure, but I didn't tell him that I don't have a price, but you asked him to go there with a paper and then you guys going to work something else, but I don't know if he's waiting for that.
I, you know, it's up to him.
Yes.
Okay.
But I put your name, your name, you're like JB.
And then he goes there.
He's going to look at, like try to look at you.
Okay.
And so I just, I was just put seven 30 as an appointment.
Yeah.
Are you going, are you going to stay there tomorrow too?
Yeah.
I'll be here tomorrow.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
What time are you going to be there?
Not, not me.
So like, nine 30 would work if you wanted to come super early, but if you wanted to come later in the afternoon, my time thoughts are,
like my time thoughts for tomorrow, nine 30.
I'm one PM, three PM and four PM.
Oh, you, you have, you wouldn't be the whole day then.
Only, only, because I, I work, I work until six.
So, so, so for nine to six you work.
Yes.
Tomorrow.
Okay.
All right.
And I'm just thinking and holding here.
Yeah.
But for seven 30, but I don't know if you're going to go today.
If you're not, because like I said, he was looking to get this card tonight.
But I know it's a little tied on time.
I'm just trying my best here, helping him.
I guess we'll be, we'll be as fast as possible.
Especially if you have that paper from cousin, like it'll be so fast.
Yeah.
And we have, like I said, we already have a car with him.
So it's a big fight, because if he has a profile and everything.
