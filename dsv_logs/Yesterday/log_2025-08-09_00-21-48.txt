Okay.
There's a main area called.
Say that again.
I'm sorry.
You can see the map it does yet.
Okay.
I just text you my business card.
Also, as far as the cash offer, I wouldn't be able to do a cash offer because it's over
ten years of age, but the consignment is where we will get the most money on consignment.
And how I can sign the process work is for 120 days to initiate the confinement process.
It is a one-time inspection fee of $499.
That would be the only money that will come out of your pocket.
The 120-day agreement will hold your coach in our inventory while we actively market and
sell it on your behalf.
If you do agree on the confinement offer, there are some documents that I would need to go
ahead and do up that agreement.
And then as far as marketing and selling the RV, our experience sells to you will employ
a comprehensive market strategy to track potential buyers for your RV.
And that includes online listing and advertising campaign.
And we aim to secure the best possible price for your RV within a degree upon time frame.
From that confinement offer, we take zero percentage from that confinement offer.
How we make our money is from the new buyers.
When we sign the estimate also, when we sell them service contracts, warranties and gap
insurance.
The turnaround time for the coach to sell is about 30 to 45 days, but it can go up to 120 days.
We're selling about 250 to 300 units a month.
We got 12 stores located within six states.
So I'm at the corporate location in O'Palaforta.
In Florida, we have five Texas.
We have two Missouri.
We have two one-in-open home offices in South Carolina.
