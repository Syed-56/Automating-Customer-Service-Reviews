Let's go on to anybody.
It's going good. What's your name sir?
Man's niche.
Man's niche. How can help you?
Now I'm calling and calling about some trucks.
Trucks.
This is fine online particular one or?
No, anybody can't remind us why I'm calling you.
Me talking from here.
Okay.
What?
I don't know anything about Nissan trucks.
So what is your what is your what is your?
What is your high?
A great question.
So, uh, need some front here.
This is, uh, what's transfer you're more familiar with?
Are you more with the four Chevy?
Uh, I, I drive a seven silver out of this is for my wife.
We've been looking at Nissan frontiers.
Um, we're trying to, trying to get some prices and
see the, the low grade to mid grade to high grade.
What kind of warranty comes with it?
What colors you offer?
Show on and so forth.
Awesome.
No, this is trying to fund the shins.
What I have everything, but let me tell you from top of my head.
So Nissan frontiers is the size of a Tacoma.
It would be more like a.
Ford maverick.
Like this is those classes.
It's more with smaller pick of chocolate.
I'm sure you've seen them when it, when the picture is Mitch.
A lot of things.
I think it's a.
Mm hmm.
Yeah.
Um, if you're, if you're looking to get the deal will, uh,
for this month, we're doing close to employee pricing for almost
a lot of our, all our cars.
So, uh, including frontiers as well.
Some of them are qualifying.
So I'll be happy to give you the best numbers and deal.
Like that's not a problem for me at all.
Uh, the colors they come with tips and their wants.
Like why they're wide black.
They have a special on such as a green, like darker green,
uh, many of my customers like the blue ones.
They have a darker and more brighter blue on.
They also have a special edition orange one.
Um, they can come on.
They promote like white, white,
they have white ones.
We do have white ones.
Yeah.
Okay.
Cool.
Okay.
So let's see.
And they have a different, um,
package trim levels.
They start with the S as a super base one.
Then S B, then, uh, pro pro X and pro for X,
which is more of an up front version of the car.
Okay.
And then they have a SL.
So this is like more of a luxurious, like full of loaded one.
I really see those available.
One of my favorite one would be an S V with the S V convenience package.
It comes with the heating seats, heating steering wheel.
It has a big screen.
Um, has a Nissan Connect service.
So we can use your app to track your car, start the car,
it has a remote start.
Uh, just a lot, a lot drivable.
Like just more than, like just on the inside LED lies.
Uh, more feature with the convenient package.
They do come with the chain cap and crew cap and king cap as a shorter one.
Uh, crew cap is for door, like full size.
They do come with a long bad and short bad.
Uh, so when you say, when you say long bad, how long is the bad?
It's six foot.
I think it's six footer.
And that's with the full floor door.
It can be, it can be either way.
Either way.
Like can be, uh, it can be, it can be, it can be king cap.
It can be, uh, it can be, uh, with the long and short bad.
Okay.
So when we can think that he will have a shorter than the crew cap,
King cap is like, uh, you know, where you have almost no space in the back.
Okay.
I cannot.
That's the one that I got.
Yeah.
My favorite, my favorite truck, if you would ask me,
it would be the, uh, frontier SV crew cap, uh,
with the SV convenience package.
This is my personal favorite.
And if you're on, I have those in the last year,
which I can do.
Okay.
What is this top of that truck?
I'm sorry.
What's that truck called?
Uh, I almost couple my hat.
I believe in Mr. Peace 42,000.
But like I said, prices are just part of my job,
especially right now.
I'll make a risk part to you.
You know what I mean?
Okay.
So 42,000 for your top notch truck.
And what kind of incentives do you have right now this month?
For incentives, uh, rebates.
Uh, I know there is a 3,500 rebates.
And we as a dealership, we're making a close to employee pricing.
Okay.
So how about this?
How about the, can you write this down?
Okay.
This truck that you're talking about, the crew cab.
What is it?
SV what?
Oh, yeah.
SV with the SV convenience package.
Okay.
I need a price on that truck right there with the incentives that you have
and the employee discount and call me back with that number.
Let me just get it.
Is this your cell phone, Mitch?
Yes, sir.
And what is your last name?
Dingman.
D-I-M-G-M-A-N.
And, um, dingman.
Dingman.
Got it.
Yeah.
I can never just should have quote for that.
Uh, like a quote for that.
And can you send me, can you take me a picture of the truck?
Okay.
Absolutely.
Can you do that for me?
I can do that for you.
This is your cell phone.
Just sign that.
Correct.
Yeah.
I can give you a note that works for you or whatever.
I'll tell you something with the easiest one.
I will ask you to appoint yes to my message.
You will get it really just so you can kind of give me permission to text you.
Yes.
And, um, I mean, can I ask you what, what are you compared to trucks to the Nissan front
and I just want to show up in like, God.
And I'm looking at a Dodge when big horn.
Um, I'm kind of just kind of feeling it out to Jase the truth.
Whoever has the best deal is who I'm going to buy a truck from.
Really?
It's from my wife.
So I don't need a full size.
Uh, she would like a full size, but we're totally fine with, uh, having a mid-sized truck as well.
Gosh, yeah.
Make sense.
Absolutely.
I will send you the pictures as well with the quote.
Of course I would like to invite you for a test drive, but.
I know you're stopping around.
I'm stopping around.
I don't like pressure or stealth.
I'll pay that right now.
I'll just quick away from me to not call you back.
Uh, I've done this before multiple times.
So, uh, you know, you know what I want.
I appreciate you for 100% if you can get that to me.
And if, uh, and if you could please, like I said, with the employee
pricing, the 3500, uh, let me know what that truck is out the door.
Okay.
Easy.
And I have a seven 80 credit score.
So it's pretty good.
Oh, that's excellent.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I'm not a presser.
God, I'm super easy to work with as well as my managers.
So I'm sure you're going to like these pre-ince here.
I, I actually like your way.
So.
We saw it.
Don't pressure me because I sort of got a vote of the next deal.
I got you this.
I got you.
Okay.
I'll be able to take some more.
I'll be happy.
I know.
We'll pop them there.
And by the way, before I hang up, big mind me, I can couple more questions.
Are you planning to buy cash or you're going to find out the truck?
No, I'm just going to find out that because she's going to trade in her.
She has a Honda E-R-B and the blue book to what she, oh, she's upside down on it.
So she's about four grand upside down on it.
So I'd have to do a trade in.
Mm hmm.
If that's possible, I'm assuming it's possible.
Yeah.
If she doesn't do it on her own, if she can't do it on her own, then it'll be me financing it.
Gotcha.
And then it's finance.
What would you think you'd do to do down?
Zero gap.
I don't want to put you in my email.
Got it.
I will push you the quote with zero down without your faces because I don't have information.
I'll be information either.
And just to make it simple for you.
I'll just put the, make the quote for you with zero down on a financing.
So, um, they have a promotion right now with the 1.9 interest rate on the frontier.
Or the rebate.
So, uh, it's for qualified buyers.
I think it.
Oh, yeah, but you are qualified with seven 80 Christ score.
Yeah.
Yes, you got it.
So the only thing that I'm worried about is obviously the trade in.
And so, because, please, that's upside down probably four grand five grand.
Okay.
Because these from what you're supposed to want to do, but so.
I mean, can you put that in there and give me a roundabout?
I don't mean like exact that maybe possibly a roundabout.
I can try.
Yeah.
I would hate to do that is because you and the mess of all the numbers.
Well, I'll see what I can do.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
And you don't have to do it right now.
Um, we're kind of busy today.
Obviously we might be able to get in there tomorrow afternoon.
Um, whatever your there next, whatever.
Um, I just want to give you some numbers first.
Like that.
Yeah.
Easy.
Super easy.
Let me ask no more questions.
I'll get back to you as soon as I get a quote.
Yeah.
I'll get a grenade again.
My name is, by Jim.
Okay.
I'm very good.
Okay.
I appreciate it.
And we'll pop some talks in this.
Take care.
All right.
Get by the.
