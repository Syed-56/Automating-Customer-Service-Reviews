Thanks for calling us and Pete.
All right, Pete, this is still going in with us.
Hey, how's it going?
Checking the sleep, anything has changed?
Are you still looking for a vehicle?
Or is this slide to come up a little bit?
No, I mean, I'm not doing that.
I actually, you know, some of the stuff,
you'll maybe get a point.
I think the market sucks right now.
And now I get it, but I think it's pretty terrible, obviously,
in that industry.
And this is just a therapy stuff for early.
I know that.
The other stuff you talked about yesterday.
But I might honestly just spend the cash.
Like, if I can get another two years out of my suburban,
some of the stuff that you highlighted,
tell us that I'm late.
Without terrible, the car was, I'm already fixed it for the 10 grandi.
And then I just, I don't have to pay you 50 grand or 55 right now.
And I think you just do whatever I want with that money.
So I think, you know, if you buy a great deal, let me know.
But I think I took it by a guy who does really good work for family friends.
He's going to give me the real story thing to make me run down.
Because obviously, you know, I felt like the car was more than that.
But if you guys did the best you can, you know, or if it's being done, you think.
I think if it's ours, because I've never spent our 11 cash,
I might just do that and I'll put a new trainee in there and so then I can,
I really just care about the size, right?
The dollar was a good deal.
I mean, I had all built in this little side.
I appreciate it so, man.
And you give it very much.
What's your guys success and all your stuff you do?
I appreciate that.
You do the same.
You ever need things to make all of this?
Oh, well, let me go see the deals.
Is the yellow clothes?
Yellow clothes?
Yeah.
That's all we have to do again.
I'm gonna keep that in place.
