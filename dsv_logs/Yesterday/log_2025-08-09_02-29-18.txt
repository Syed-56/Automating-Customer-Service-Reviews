Thank you for the comments, don't worry.
Hey there, sorry it was really quiet.
Would you say your name was?
Carlos.
Carlos, hey, I happen to be in the colony taking my son to an event and I wanted to see what
kind of used cars I've had on hand.
I'm looking for my wife, really, so it's going to be a car for a kid, but my wife
really likes Honda CRVs.
You all have any used Honda CRVs?
Let me check if you want to check in the CRVs in.
Yes, CRV.
Say if we have two in stock, let me make sure that they're here at the bottom.
I can't pull up the groove out of it, so it's something to say.
Honda.
Probably.
Yeah, no.
No, I had an Odyssey in a password from Honda.
Your signal is cutting out real bad, I can't pull it the sounds together.
Thank you for calling me for all my other solutions.
I wanted to wheel you on.
I can't help you.
Yeah, I was just talking to Carlos.
Trying to ask him about some used CRVs, but I don't know if the signal was really bad and
then he was gone and they said I was listening to music and you answered again.
So I don't know if he thought he was done talking to you in hung up or if he lost his
signal.
Can you tell me what the sound is?
No, that's me.
I'm in use for us.
My name is Leon.
Carlos is a failed vendor, so he was probably busy.
I see right in the front of the ears, one of the cover deals.
So let me see which thing I'll leave you looking at, okay?
Yeah.
Do you remember, let me see if the CRVs for you.
Let me see what I have here.
One second, sir.
Did you see one online you like?
No, I just was here in the area, dropping my spin-off through our driving test and so I
just am calling a couple dealerships that are close to see if anyone has one.
Okay.
Okay.
I have a, actually a 2023 CRV.
It's a EX, yeah, well, 20,000 miles on it.
What's the price?
A 209750.
Okay.
Let's look for something older, a little older.
We're older, so let me see here.
Like, 2017 to 2020, somewhere that range.
Okay.
Let me see what I was like.
Do you live in an area?
Well, we live in Carrollton, but I'm just in the county here for my son, who was in the
tub.
Okay.
I'm looking right now.
I want to tell you how to have a 2070 is a civic sport and it's only 18,000, 18,250,
if 32,000 miles.
You know, I'm looking for a CRV, so just that one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just that one.
What I'll do is, um, I will, we hit him in all the time.
We're a very huge dealership and I can take a name and remember when I get one of the
hand around in that price range, but I get one in this weekend.
I'll just shoot you a call and send you a video, because you can actually see it before you
come out and then we'll just go from there and have a thought.
Sounds good.
I can't even know what I'm looking for.
So.
908.
And your first and last name.
Uh, Corey, CREY, MOS, MOSS.
Okay.
Just some miles one name is Leon and, uh, I said, we make it one end.
It's leaking the making one end tonight.
You know, so you're looking in that 18 price range on the 20 price range.
Um, looking for something from like 2017 to 2020 somewhere in there.
Okay.
I'm looking for, um, letter seats, not black seats.
Um, oh, okay.
Yeah, that's about all the, the rest of it probably doesn't really matter that much, but that's
not only hates dark seats, I want letter seats because I'll hide the stains.
And that rest doesn't really probably matter.
Okay.
Well, fair pass.
You know, you got someone out here looking for you.
So, and continue on your search and if I come across something, I'll definitely give you
a call.
Thanks, Leon.
I appreciate it.
Thank you, sir.
Bye.
Bye.
