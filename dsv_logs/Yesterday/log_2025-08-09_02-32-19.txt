I'm calling the state that was still available.
And then also, I do have a trade-in that I want to do.
And I was wondering how do you guys price your trade-ins?
You guys go off with blue book or how does that work?
I'm in Southern California.
So I'm a bit of waste.
We basically price them according to the market.
We'll look at a quarter.
We're going to look at the retail.

We're going to look at what they're selling for on the market.

It's a 22F 250s area.
Okay.
It's got a mile.
It's got low miles.
It's only got around 25,000 miles on it.
25,000 miles.
To be honest, you would price them your value.
