Transcript:
to one of our talented team members from Kargurus.
This is the first one.
That's a good one.
Thank you.
Hello.
Thank you for calling the shop.
Hey, thank you for calling Trump on today's sales.
My name is Nick.
We're going to have the pleasure of speaking with.
My name is Sandra.
Hey, Sandra, how can I help you?
Yeah, hi.
I wanted to know about the Terraform Model 3 long range 2018 that you have.
Yeah.
I think I've signed a Zinn number or something.
I know we don't have, we have the one.
So it makes it easier to kind of narrow down.
Let me just look it up one second.
And by the way, if we are phones used the internet, if we get this connected, is this a good number to reach you back at?
Yes.
Okay.
And I do see that you had reached out.
So I have the stock number, it makes it nice and easy.
Can you just pull it up?
What specific question did you have that I can answer for you?
I wanted to know if this car was available for the Colorado Electric Card Text Credit.
Yeah.
So, so to be honest with you, I don't know that much about that program, but I have a colleague, his name is EZOTY.
And I see that he had reached out and he's going to know a lot more about that than I do.
It's not that I don't want to give you information.
I just don't want to give you wrong information.
You know what I mean?
Right.
And also, I wanted to know if this vehicle had a car fax on it.
Has it ever been in any kind of accidents or, you know, what's the maintenance?
Yeah.
Let me take a look.
If it doesn't, mention that, you know.
Yeah.
Let's see.
Just point it up for you or Internet is a little bit slow.
Just bear with me.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I'm going to pull up the car fax saying no accident or damage reported based on the car fax.
Teng was a one on their vehicle.
It was a personal vehicle for them.
And the first owner, they had it for six years, eight months.
And I don't see a ton of information on that car fax.
No.
Let me check something else.
So we did the normal use car inspection on it.
We mounted and balanced four tires.
So it has new tires.
And then we see what else I can find.
Or, yeah.
Also, too.
Definitely the battery condition.
That's the...
Yeah.
So, you're going to be the first question.
Yeah.
I don't see that I have that information here.
So when you do our inspection, they look at safety.
It's just going to be things like air bags are good,
brakes work, tires are good, that's what it's saying.
So I don't have any information on that specific question that I can see.
Are you guys able to check the battery?
Because that's the major component of the vehicle is...
I mean, it's a electric car.
So I need to know the range available.
The range is says 310, but is it really 310?
And you have to remember, 2018.
Yeah.
Makes sense.
So let me ask for service.
Yeah.
It's a really good point.
That's a good point.
So, I think, let me ask our service department if that was something they could do.
I'm also for you.
I'm looking up the...
I want to see what the warranty is like.
Okay.
Obviously, you don't want to buy a car that needs warranty work, but let me see...
Let's see here.
So Google is saying that it comes with an eight year 120,000 mile, so whichever comes first,
warranty for the battery and the driving unit, which would be the motor.
If the battery...
If the battery capacity drops below 70% they would be a warranty claim.
And...
Sport of course, 2004 car?
Yes.
That's the Tesla warranty.
So let me go talk to our service department and see what capability they have for testing that battery.
You might have to put you on a brief hold.
Oh, no.
I'll hold yet.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, Sandra.
Thank you.
So my understanding is that there is a way to test the battery.
Lots of follow-up with our people that do the reconditioning and stuff to see if that's a tool that they have.
But we can definitely check in to that.
And I can have Mr. Yivoti follow-up with you about that.
Thank you.
How is the interior?
Is the interior pristine?
Like, you know, are there any tears?
Are there any is it clean?
Is it the person that was the sloppy and evidence of food fill?
You know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you have a minute for me to walk out there and take a look?
Yeah.
Or I can have...
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
You know what I would recommend?
So they say that it pictures worth a thousand words.
We have the ability.
We can send you a video.
Would that be something that would be helpful?
Just seeing...
Okay.
I'm very honest, but rather than, you know, taking me at my work, we can send a video and
would that be fair?
Yeah, that would be fair.
Okay.
So I do see that Mr. E. Vody had text to you with the text message often.
Would you mind pulling up your text and you just respond back to you?
Just on my email.
You were my email.
You just...
You just...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let me make sure I have the right.
Looks like I might have a different phone number on file.
Is that not a crime?
That's not me, no.
Did you live in a criminal dad?
I live in a criminal dad, but that's not me.
Okay.
Okay.
Let me write down your phone number.
It's going to be the one ending.
Wait five zero?
Yes.
Okay.
One second.
Okay.
And also, I need to find out if the text credit, if I would be able to qualify for text credit.
Oh, hang on just a second.
I'm sorry.
Is that important?
I have to have the phone away from my face so that I could get your phone number.
What was the last part you said?
The text credit.
That's a comment.
Yes, I did leave.
A record card text credit.
Yeah, I do leave him a note.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll tell you this.
Is this car qualified for that?
Okay.
I can definitely do that.
Because I didn't know what's going on.
If you're a dealership or whatever is not registered with the state of Colorado to do the text credit, then it doesn't qualify.
There's just like certain certain places.
And they said it was an advertisement and I didn't see it going into the store.
Yeah, we can definitely take a look at that.
Okay.
Okay.
It was really wonderful to speak with you and you voting will send you that video today.
Okay.
And we respond to you today.
Yeah.
Okay.
You have a wonderful day.
Yeah.
You take care.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
