Thank you for calling Landover.
The other one is going to be showing you on the map as well.
The question I just received in a printable email on a vehicle we were looking at and I was hoping somebody could go over it with me.
Give me a second here please.
What is your phone number ma'am?
1 4 2
2 4 3
That was regarding 2021 Landover Discovery Sports.
Yes.
Correct.
Okay.
That would be your talking with Pedro.
Obviously he is off today but what kind of question do you have?
Is it an information or general question?
Yes.
Finance question.
Okay.
Let me transfer you to Ryan which is my finance manager.
He got a better answer for you.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
What?
Wait.
No.
No.
I think we're holding this as Ryan.
My name is Courtney Coonsler and I am just calling regarding approval email.
I just got on a pre-owned vehicle we were looking to purchase yesterday.
I just had a couple questions on that approval.
Yes.
Absolutely.
So my first question is that I don't understand if it's saying I have to have a down payment or I can.
Because it lets me adjust it on here to see a payment.
So I don't understand if the bank is saying I have to have a down payment or I don't.
No.
No.
So that system that they send everything to it's called Roadster and it allows you to just
and kind of play around with the numbers.
I got approved with no money down.
Okay.
And that was also without that trade because last night when you guys were here we ran into the trade title was signed over already.
Yep.
And I have an appointment at Motor Vehicle tomorrow to trade the title over to her name.
Oh, perfect.
Okay.
So if it is then I submit it was zero money down and no trading got that approval.
So that's toy fine.
When you come in we will actually adjust.
We'll give you an actual paper write up like when you were here.
That'll show the trade on there with that $2,000 down.
But I submit it with no money down.
So it's just no money down on there.
Okay.
And then my next question is 21% interest.
That's really, really, really high.
Right.
I'm not crazy.
No, that's one of the highest actually the state of Colorado.
Wow.
I think 20.5 is the highest.
So big thing is his credit not real solid.
But then she doesn't actually pull a credit score.
So they're looking at it as a first time buyer.
The other thing to the book value on the vehicle.
We're borrowing more because of no money down.
We're borrowing over book value on there.
So maybe book value is 20,000, 600 and some odd dollars.
And so we're borrowing 27,000.
So when it's over 120% it's called loaned value.
We're going to bump that rate up as well.
So I was actually, this is all I have every bank I submitted to,
which I submitted to several banks.
This is the only approval I got.
This is through Land Rover Financial Group.
And we send them so much business that when we do send them
them ones like these that are first time buyers things like that,
they usually auto approve and do it.
So I was actually surprised I got it with no money down.
But yeah, that was unfortunate.
It could be a hefty one.
So what I would tell you guys, keep the loan for six months
a year paid on it's going to build her credit and then just read it.
That's what I was thinking too.
But I did have a question for you.
I don't know if it's a possibility or not.
Could you possibly run my credit?
And see if I would get in it better interest rate than my husband?
Yeah.
So same process.
They would have to send you the credit app.
I'll get with you on this and have them shoot that over to you.
Or you can go on to our website and just fill out the credit application.
And then once we look for it, then yeah, I can definitely submit it with you instead
of your husband.
Absolutely.
But you make more money than me and everything's joint.
Do you think I've got to make a difference?
I mean, we have.
I don't understand.
Okay.
Let me back up.
We have really good payment history and we have really good credit.
It's just the debt to income is very high.
I'm wondering if that's where the interest rate is coming from because it's not like we miss
payments.
It's just the debt.
Probably because his score, if I remember correctly, it was like six or eight.
So it was.
Oh, that is low.
His score should not be that low.
Yeah.
Very low.
It's also on top of that.
And you have her which she doesn't even have a credit score, which sometimes, you know,
that's better than bad credit, you know, but it's not good in their eyes, you know, but
right.
My first thought alone when I was like, gosh, 19, my dad co-signed.
I mean, it was like 19% it was terrible.
But unfortunately, you know, that's a good way to build it.
But yeah, you pay that down.
But yeah, we could definitely.
So what your thing is it might be better if we took her off, but that's not our whole goal.
But it could be a little bit better if we took her off.
I don't think it's going to make a difference either way with her on there with him.
It's more so because of his credit.
You know, I mean, that's that's really, really tough.
So, okay.
I would say my dad has been 40.
Do you think that would help?
That's why I make much of a difference now.
Okay.
Unless you're like mid sevens or eight hundred.
No.
And that's when it would make a huge difference.
No, because we have too much for condensed.
Yeah.
I totally get it.
But usually anything under 700 is going to be that tier of credit.
So I honestly don't think it can make any difference.
Okay.
Then we're not going to do that.
I have one last question for you.
And I don't know that we would go this route.
I just want to do some options.
His mom offered to co-sign for her and she is in the eight hundred.
Is that something that we could do?
So that is possible that she needs to live in the same household.
Because if you're co-signing, then you both have to individually qualify if you don't live in the same household.
So she wouldn't individually qualify by herself, but your mom would.
So she lived with you guys or does she have a different address?
She has a different address.
There's no way to get around that one.
Yep.
Nope.
That one.
Because even if we put her at your address, they would fit us for proof of residence to prove that.
And she would be able to be sticking the money at that point.
Right.
Okay.
Okay.
So I think that's everything.
And like you said, I can use this system.
So if I adjust it and I say, okay, we're getting 2000 for the trade-in, it's going to show me her payment.
Right.
It'll show you exactly.
It'll show you that.
Okay.
Because basically you over the rate in the term and then you can adjust.
So just add in, I believe, if I remember correctly 2000, they were giving you for the trade values.
So just one and put it as if you're doing a $2000 down payment.
And we'll also get a write-up for you when you come in and show you all that and go over it with the flow.
Okay.
Would you say it's best to come in tomorrow when I actually have the title for the range?
Yeah.
Until you have that, we won't really be able to do anything.
I was just waiting until you get that.
I mean, we're holding the car for you and everything.
We have the approval.
So I don't have to worry on that part.
So, but yeah, you'll definitely want to get that title because that's also one of those where, you know, we need that to be perfected before we could actually take it in because that's not a part.
We're going to retail and resale.
So we need that title to send it to our auction.
Totally understand.
If I were to fix that car, do you guys think you would sell it and give me more for it?
Probably not with that age.
Okay.
Anything once you get into that age, it's just so hard because it's more of a liability for us to sell because if a customer did buy it, obviously we're a very big, reputable brand where we're going to actually, you know,
or into it.
We're going to warrant you getting back our product.
And so it just could be such a huge issue at that point in such an unknown that we would wholesale it to like an auction or something just because we probably just get out of it for what we own it.
Then don't have to worry about it.
The other thing I would tell you, I mean, you may look in, you know, cars that age, like with my last one, it wasn't worth anything to anybody.
So I donated mine because I got like a,
gosh, it's like a $3,000 tax credit.
Okay.
That's an option to look into a lot of churches, good wills, things like that.
They take those and I mean, you can use that tax right off.
The other one would be, there's a lot of places out there that they may resale like buy here.
So here places, car, man, you know, they may ship around other places.
I mean, it's worth looking into the tip of giving more, but just, I don't, I don't see what the miles were.
I'm stuck on that and I don't appraise vehicles.
So, but with age of a vehicle, I mean, that's 15 years old at that point.
It is.
So it's really hard for a big retailer to resell that vehicle.
So.
Okay.
Okay.
I appreciate all your help and honesty on all these questions.
I promise I think this is my last one.
They did speak to her last night about an extended warranty on this vehicle, speaking of.
I gave her, I gave her that quote and everything on there.
And I like you and us know, you know, I want to, I told my want to help you guys out.
Obviously her first car and it's from four and a half that warranty where that quote that I gave you guys.
We would do a thousand dollars off of that price for you.
The only thing though is that the bank will not allow us to put that into the financing.
So that would be.
What's my next question?
I don't have the quote.
I don't see where you sent it.
Can you give me that price again?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can, I can email it over to you.
Okay.
Let me go grab the file and then what's a good email for you?
All right.
That's perfect.
Yeah.
Okay.
Perfect.
Let me go grab the folder and get that quote for you.
Then I'll email it over to you.
And with that, you know, we can, whatever price you see on there, they're non-text.
So that's one thing.
Okay.
So that's about the warranty.
And then the, I can't remember what the miles were on the vehicle.
But if I remember correctly, it was under 10,000 miles, right?
On the, no, it's 50,000.
Oh, that's right.
It was 50,000.
So that one there.
Yeah.
It is those price and see like I said, their tax stream.
We could just do that on a credit card.
So if you get points or miles, it's a great way to put them away.
So it was her being up.
I believe she said in Nebraska.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We've got to do something if we're going to buy another range because they're beautiful.
But do I'm there expensive to fix?
Well, she's just no work close up there.
Right.
Anywhere at all.
Like you do have a certified certification on that.
But that's just so far.
I mean, with the warranty, she can go to any AS, he certified mechanic, anywhere at all.
Okay.
So you have to pay the deductible and move on with life.
And you know, she doesn't have to get it towed 300 miles back to Denver.
Right.
And is that something that we can purchase at a later time or is that something that we need to purchase now?
You can, but I would tell you don't purchase it.
Okay.
Which is just in the vehicle because one of the things we do is we inspect the vehicle and put a power train warranty on all of our use cars.
And so the company knows that we do that.
So they discount these warranties when it's sold with vehicle.
If you don't, one, you have to get it inspected back here at our dealership, which is 300 dollars.
You have to get the car back here too.
But also, then it's sold is not sold with vehicle.
And so it's just rated in the system differently.
And it usually adds anywhere between $800 to $1,200 usually at what I see.
So it is always your best price to buy it when you're buying the vehicle.
And that's why I also told them, I mean, they're expensive.
I don't know if he showed you that charter pricing or anything.
I mean, I've fair warned, they are expensive.
And they're relative to the house spent in those cars.
Are you already know that?
Right.
The nice thing too when you're looking at that quote, you can cancel the warranty.
So if you've got it like a six year warranty and surely have the car for four years or whatever it is,
you can cancel it if you trade or sell that vehicle and get a pro rated refund back on those as well.
But I told them I'll do that $1,000 off on the price.
I'll put that in the body of the email so you can't buy it.
I'm writing as well for you.
Okay.
Whatever one you need to take care of you on there because it's so important.
Okay.
Okay. Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.
And then service who has my vehicle right now waiting on us to make a decision.
Should I call them and let them know that I spoke with you, I've got the approval.
We're not coming down until tomorrow.
We'll be taking, let me have the loaner for another day or do I need to bring that back.
No, no, they should let you have that another day.
That shouldn't be any sort of problem or anything.
Okay.
Okay.
So, we've decided to move forward with purchasing a vehicle.
We'll be coming in tomorrow.
Do you know around what time you want to come in tomorrow?
So, the motor vehicle appointments at two o'clock.
So, I'm hoping we can be to you guys by like four.
Okay.
Sounds great.
Okay.
Sounds good.
Thank you.
If you have questions, I just can be a shout out to you in the email back.
I can answer any questions you have.
Awesome.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.
Bye.
Result: [2] Yes, at a loose time or range of time exceeding 1 hour
