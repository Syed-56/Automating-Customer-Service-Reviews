I think it's a good idea.
Thank you for calling to LTO to visit
Colo speaking with Mel Pia.
I can't hear a thing with last week.
And they told me I didn't get a tool.
So I just want to ask, so it's a hard-listening word.
So even though I have a bad query for the reason I'm going to do the tools,
it's quite because I need some type of data, right?
I'm sorry, I need to see who you are working with.
Do you remember the name of the soldier?
Oh, me, Daniel, I'm not saying that.
Josh?
What was I?
D-O-S-E.
Okay, let me look into a what was your name?
Gen-Y-D-N-R-O-Y.
Okay.
Because I want to make sure because I put it out of the money by the next,
not next to the final week.
That is by $5,000.
I don't want to make sure that if I bring money in,
I would like, when I'm going to go for a bank for a call-in.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
The role here, that's it.
I'm going to help you go.
I'm going to play here.
I want to ask you a question.
I can be a thing too easy to go.
And I mean, who's going to go on?
But what I mean was I put it wasn't good.
So the only thing that I get a tool is because I need some data,
and that's something that's not in it.
Let's tell them something.
Yeah, the tool.
They didn't have a question in order to get approved.
They were saying like $1,000 or $2,000.
I wonder if this is nothing, I'm sure.
But the thing is, in the next two weeks,
I put that $5,000.
So my credit is not that good.
But I just want to make sure that,
well, I think it's a tool for like $1,000,
that I want to.
Well, yeah, but that's it.
It changes for every customer,
depending on their credit score.
I don't know how much they are due to put down payment,
because it depends on your credit score.
That's what the bank requires, not us.
So I don't know if they tell you an exact amount of amount of,
you know, an exact number.
Well, well, they were saying last time,
they were saying that if I have like $1,000,
$2,000, whatever it is,
I get this on an exact amount of making work,
which was $1,000.
That's it.
Oh, okay.
You don't have that kind of money right now?
No.
I was about $5,000 in the case.
Okay.
Well, if you want,
I'll just put it all the way.
I can't wait.
And when you have that money, just come back.
And we can try that out.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
One more thing for you.
So with that, right, that, what's the problem?
I have to go left.
I'm at the 26,000, I mean, 26,000,
how much was the car?
Yeah.
That money, the money goes to a car.
We don't need the money.
Okay.
Okay.
But the amount of the people.
Uh huh.
Well, no, it's okay.
No, I was going to tell you that.
The money is like some kind of commitment
that the bank needs to approve you.
That money is over.
Oh, for it.
For it.
If you pay that off the car.
Oh, okay.
So the basis though, it's the even like you're a bad
card.
You want to make sure that you have some, some
type of money done.
Exactly.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, the thing is, um,
the next two weeks, I'm not having,
but I'm going to get that card.
I think that, uh, to me, the term, um,
um, anything is, is it,
is it, as a pre-owned?
Does that take care of the housing?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So how about I want to get that card next to the
door?
But I want to get that card next to this.
Okay.
And, uh, I mean, yeah, if, if we get, uh,
sold, we, we will let you know.
We can try to figure it out and find something that,
like you like.
Okay.
So, so, so, part of that is, is that right?
Yes.
Five thousand, you should be good.
Okay.
But I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
What they told you in finance.
That's why I'm telling you.
Sometimes they use you the exact amount of, uh,
money that you need to in order to get a proof,
where, well,
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
Okay.
Perfect.
We'll keep in touch.
Okay.
Good to go.
Sorry.
How to go on.
Be safe.
Hey, sir.
How about you go?
