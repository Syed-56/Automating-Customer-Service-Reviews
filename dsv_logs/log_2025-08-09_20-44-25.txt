Thank you for calling. Could we like me on this? Well, this is what I heard the pleasure of speaking with.
This is Larry Reed. I'm giving money to still people's, um, the show, the callback.
Oh, okay. Let me go ahead and put you on. Hope you're for one moment. Mary.
All right. Thank you. Get your hold up here.
Okay.
Okay. Let me, uh, let me go ahead and get you over to the town one moment.
Okay. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you for holding this as Michelle.
I'm going to show this, Larry.
Hey, how are you?
I'm good going on the walk with my little son.
Oh, you sounds cute.
I was, uh, calling earlier about the rock street past my year.
Yeah. Yeah. Very, um, interested in it. I, um, found it on, um,
I think it was cards dot com. I'm not sure.
Then doing a little research on what was going to be his best.
She's forced and I really like the, um,
the design of the devil as opposed to the traditional design of the past
violence. It's a little bit more regging than he's 40.
Absolutely. Yeah.
That's what I was talking about. The rock street train was pretty good like that.
Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty cool.
Uh, cause I'm a dad got, uh, a one and a half year old son and I have, uh,
twin daughters that are three years old.
Oh, wow. Yeah, but I'm, uh, fighting through the nail, not to be in a mini band.
So I'm still trying to keep my cool little brother.
Right. We're going to get you a cool parent.
No, I'm not a man.
Yeah, I can't do it. I ain't talking about the adults.
I'm going to get that door slide. I just see their soul even their body.
That's, that's the way. Um, do you have the room to come,
combine and see the rock street today because I said,
Michelle, I wish that could.
I'm going to be very honest with you about a couple of things.
One, this is going to be time to be look what we had a, um,
a used vehicle that we had for a number of years and she kind of gave up on us.
So getting around is, uh, very difficult.
So I'm doing as much as a footwork in backhand,
where mostly until everything matches up.
And then we come in by Uber or whatever.
I'll take care of it and do the test drive and find a paperwork.
What I'm trying to do is post the pop.
Because I did these shows you about all of the people that would be coming with me.
That's a bit much to do back and forth.
Um, where, what is, uh, where do you all at?
What area do you live in?
Oh, we're in mid ground.
I'm writing the heart of downtown.
Okay.
Okay.
It's possible.
I mean, if we may end up making it, you know, coming to an agreement and everything,
then we probably be able to come to you.
Oh, that'd be awesome.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, did you clear like that 45 cells, right?
Yeah.
We're actually in Coerin Lake City.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
We're right.
We mean, just out there for like, but yeah.
Okay.
Um, so what, um, my questions would be about to be here.
And it's because I have never actually seen one of this trim in person, but I have something
in a g-time path behind the, the old one, the end of New York.
So I know about the fit of this.
Okay.
What do we think about just from your knowledge of Canada and everything?
Uh, three, three cards piece in, uh, to a doubt.
Oh, yeah.
Atticulate completely out of it.
Yeah.
It's got to be the three, the three year olds are going to be, uh, typically in the back.
And my wife, she always likes to be in the center part with, um, my son to get to take care
of him and get a reach back there if they need anything.
Uh, the only concern I have about it is, and she actually is not opposed to it anymore, is
that it's a bench seat.
And we used to really, really only want cap and feet because you can go easily from the second
to the third row.
But lately she's like, I actually don't mind bench feet.
Really?
Yeah.
And I, and it's weird.
I think she will have something up for me.
When I pay up for three, I think she wants another one.
Uh-oh.
Mm-hmm.
That's why I think she wants a lot of kidney.
If you're a little football team.
Hey, if I do a little degree of soccer, not football, football two games these days, dad,
dad, play dad by the end of the day.
Is that is true. So what that being said all rock please come
up. Vince reading was especially different that I'm looking at it's been seen right.
Let me triple take hold of one second.
What's your problem?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
Well, how am I wait?
Wait, wait.
Ooh, that's confusing. I love that. You know what? I don't know.
Because the way the picture looks that can be the picture of the foot.
Yeah, I know.
I'm confusing to me too. That's what I was going to actually do.
That's what I'm going to be able to see.
Actually, yeah.
Actually, it's like a big slide.
Right.
And the only other thing that's that third row is the third row is a bench and the middle row is two bucket seats.
Oh, okay.
Cool. Yeah, that's what I really want.
And that is your birthday home on down.
I can only say that because it says seven is a seven person passenger, but I am going to get a video sent over to you.
That'd be great. And if we could find out what the OTV on it would be possible.
And oh, here's a big question.
Michelle, this is what that test that's doing research.
So you guys have any that owns and mark up.
Um,
that's out of my page.
Give us a bit of the person that sent you the video.
It's going to be one of my product specialists.
And they'll be able to enter that question because I'm not sure.
Okay.
All right.
And this is your company.
Great.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm going to have them.
They're going to send it here.
And they're probably going to give you a call just to introduce themselves as well.
Okay.
Yeah.
Cause I'm going to want to know if there are any rebates available by being certified to your own and all that.
That just helps us out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And they're going to be able to have all that info for you.
So I will it will be within the next plus.
Less than 15 minutes.
Sounds good.
Awesome.
Thank you, Mary.
Thank you.
