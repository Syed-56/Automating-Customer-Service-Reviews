And I designed value max for one reason to offer the most value for people looking to sell
their vehicle.
In our unique two-step process does just that by offering an aggressive upfront instant
payout with the opportunity to earn more when your vehicle sells again at retail.
Value max is truly the smarter way to sell your car.
