It's a great day at Q&S RV at Lake Mills.
If you know your party's extension, you may dial it at any time or press 8 for the company directory.
For service, two for sales, three for parts.
This is shoes or a big mill hook and I hope you.
You guys ever call like something, some thing, some thing or another.
Yes, it used to be called fat-edge country campers.
Fat-edge, that's what I wanted.
Yes, because we bought our camper from you guys in the middle of the head.
A cute dog there.
I'm not going to use to pet the dog.
No, I have a cute dog here with me today.
Oh, well, fantastic.
Well, we have absolutely a lot of our sports track and we are ready now to the Forest River
camp in addition to fit the wheel.
So, I'm not in the market, but my friend is in the market for a camp of the...
What is it a campaign edition?
Which is a main edition?
It doesn't matter.
We have the fifth wheel, but I'm calling for my friend anyway.
We have the campy and the difference.
Yeah, it's super nice.
Yeah, it's a nice thing.
I'm trying to help on wheels for sure.
Yeah, it's really nice.
So, if you can fit her criteria, I can set her up to you.
Send her up to you.
So, she's looking for not a walk through bathroom.
So, she likes to bath in separate.
That's number one.
Number two, she needs an outdoor kitchen.
That's important.
Number three, it has to be around the $20,000 range.
Okay.
And no bunk.
Okay, how big?
Um, they can talk about $9,000.
Yeah, I have some stuff.

My name is Chris.
And they used to be called SADHAD.
SADHAD has definitely bought our sports track from and late
mils.
And let me walk out.
Okay.
They have campers that would completely fit your criteria with your no walk
through bathroom, no bunk and an outdoor kitchen in your price range that can
fill up to 9,000.
And they're both.
I have two in mind that are both super, super clean like
and quality.
And that have already been the wrong spectrum that have nothing at
all wrong with them zero that are both really, really, really,
really nice.
One of them is I have a Cherokee.
2019 Cherokee that's totally smallest.
And I have like a 2018 Keystone Sprinter that's great to.
Okay.
Both have the outdoor kitchen, both have that rear bathroom that's
great.
No walkthrough that are right.
You know, they're both great campers.
Did you then heard the, the least hit both of these that you were
talking about?
Sure.

No, I'm just kidding.
So, movies are great because it's so funny.
Those movies like most movies when they fight like the bad guy at the end,
it's like, you know, there's like suspense, you know, those movies
is like a total beat down.
Like you just finally get there and he's just like destroys them.
Yep.
It's pretty funny.
Um, where are you located?
I'm sorry.
I was trying to blind.
I didn't know that you guys.
I didn't know.
Sorry about the adults on there.
I was like, what is that?
I almost hung up.
I didn't know where they went.
What is I was telling you and then I realized I didn't, when I was telling you,
I was connecting you.
I didn't connect you and I kept you on hold.
Oh, come back.
Yeah.
I'll show you the links you want to come by today.
I have some time today.
Yeah.
I think if we will, um, the next week or so is going to be kind of busy.
So, but if you can send me the link that we still know if we're even interested.
Yeah, for sure.
And then he and I can discuss that.
Where are you from?
Uh, we live in West Dallas, but we're across the street from New Berlin.
Oh, all right.
Five minutes from dawn.
You ever go to that place?
It's called the local.
It's like just outside of New Berlin.
Yeah.
Oh, I don't think so.
It's delicious.
It's amazing.
It's a restaurant.
Yeah.
It's probably like a day of this burger.
It's a top three burger.
I've lived all over the country.
I grew up in Boston and spent time in New York, Chicago,
lived in Chicago, lived in LA.
And it's like a top three burger I've ever had.
Really?
Oh, my God.
We have to take that place out.
Yeah.
But I never find out a local restaurant called the local.
It's in some town.
Just out.
It's just past the it's just a federal borders of New Berlin.
I can't remember the town of 10, but it's called the local.
Okay.
I'll have to look at it.
Yeah, he too.
Totally.
100%.
But you know, I thought about them.
And since he had something that was, I mean,
we've looked marching up right there and we really liked it very
unfair.
So I thought what the heck I'll just give them a call.
So good.
Yeah.
I appreciate it.
I will.
And then he is.
How much are they?
I told you.
I told you.
My friends are around like 20,000.
So how much are they?
I think one of them is like 19 or eight.
And then the other one is like 17.
I can.
It's not.
It's better.
Okay.
And they're both really, really, really nice.
Like seriously, really nice.
Okay.

And I'm just, you know, just independent dealers is actually good for them.
Like the people that ran country campers when they sold the
food they stayed on here.
Yeah.
And one of them just recently retired and one of them is still with us.
It was two brothers.

But it was a great travel trailer, but we needed to upgrade it to this fifth wheel.
And you guys just didn't have anything that we wanted.
And when we saw the Forest River Champan edition.
