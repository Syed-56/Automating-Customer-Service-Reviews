Hi, Katie. This is Lajerna. I'm back.
Hi. Yeah. Hi. Okay. So that vehicle is currently in the inspection process.
So it's not available to test drive today, but what I can do is take your information and reach out to you one Monday, and give you one update and when it will be available. Is that okay?
Okay. So I'm wondering, is there any possible way for us to take a look at it today?
It's all right at the moment. So it's not actually here at the dealership.
Okay. Do you know what time of day on Monday you would anticipate it be back?
It's hard to tell. It was just taking off a lot a few days ago. It's going to give it... It's given off a lot inspection and repair.
The best I can do is give you a car early Monday morning at about nine o'clock or nine thirty.
I'm going to give you a different number to reach me at. Okay. All right. Whenever you're ready for it. Yeah. So it's six months.
Okay.
Okay. Got it. May I have your last thing, please? Sure. It's Waller, which is L-A-W-L-C-R. Great.
And then what I'm going to do here, Katie, I'm going to send you a quick opt-in to text.
So that way we can talk the texting, if you're able to get to the phone right away.
And I'll be able to say you hopefully some pictures before you arrive if it's available for that. Okay.
Okay. That'd be great. Okay. Let me just go ahead and do that really quick.
Okay. All right. All right.
All right. I just sent you that option to talk to the opt-in.
And if you want to go ahead and accept that for me, then that way we can have another form of communication.
And I'll let you know early as I can on Monday to the status.
Okay.
Okay.
Perfect. Should be getting that still. Yes. Okay.
Just got it. I appreciate you hopefully.
You know, we'll talk on Monday morning and get you out to the test drive. Okay.
That would be really great. Thank you for your time.
