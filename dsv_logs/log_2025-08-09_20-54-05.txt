Thank you for calling her in her civil rights. You look at the people. This is for you. I have to wrap you.
Hi, my sleeping child's face.
Yeah, I love it.
Thank you for holding us. It's hard to help you.
Hey, Charles. This is a new thing.
Every morning, it's 20 minutes ago.
This is where let me get you pulled up here real quick. I know I received a cast of lead from you.
We still have a Marker Verme equal, sir.
You see it. I am perfect to think it was.
If my name is Richard, I'm going to pull up with a track.
Just correct.
And they can only have a lot.
Did you have any time in the afternoon to combine?
Take a look at our inventory. See what's going to fit you in the best.
Yeah, so I'm just looking at what the top goal was.
It's a very big motto thing. I could probably drop by.
I have a meeting and known and I can't give it to group for hours.
So I don't know if you have any availability of three, four talks.
If I forget their sooner, I'll get this one.
Yeah, absolutely. I can put you down for the four o'clock appointment.
If you get here three or two, 30 or something like that, there's no problem.
We can accommodate you. Just check in with reception and we'll have some options ready for you.
And could you start it? Okay.
Yes. I don't want to waste anybody's time.
So I'm looking at the option I think was a $20,000 or whatever it was.
Here, I'm going to see here.
I hate it with a photo.
I'm sorry. I can't show.
Yes. No problem.
You're fine. You have a base with 25, 20,500.
And then some destinations and some check-throughs involved in there.
Correct. And then we'll have the Toronto membership.
It's just kind of been specific to and on our deep specific track.
We can serve that in there as well.
Yeah, I know.
I find it's huge for us right here.
This should be good.
Looks like we have a one-order sit there up there.
And we should be sure to have a good amount of options for different terms of level.
4-year to take a look at it.
I should be there.
5-5-4 is related to no other colleges.
Okay.
That sounds good.
We'll be seeing it this afternoon.
Anything changes? I'll give it 4.
Sounds good. Thank you.
Very fun. Bye.
