Hey, you're speaking, can I help you?
You're going to speak to Dorto.
Hey, Pete, how are you?
Okay, hey, I started in the vacuum,
put an answer.
I was in a meeting up in Rochester.
No, you're just going to go back from Rochester now,
but I've got to done questions for you.
Yes, sir.
What bank do you use for financing?
Well, so many.
So, I can't let first national bank.
No, I don't think we use first national.
No, you're quite the big guy.
You have spent coming to an ally,
she's, you know, what a big guy.
Okay, what's the best rate you can get me from one of those banks?
I'm in the car, probably in the sixes.
Okay, because they want to do the loan,
but that's okay.
I'm going to give a kid who does it.
I have the allocation still there if they're not.
That's fine.
I don't care.
I've been through business yet.
I got to do what you got to do.
I did try that morning.
I still have one available.
So if you want to, you can get it.
Okay.
Okay.
So, okay.
What I'm probably going to do is I'm probably going to,
right around sixes, that is a non-binary.
And then, although my goal is to buy a trade again when I'd like to give an allocation on a turbo,
I'll drive this until I get the turbo.
And that's where my plan is.
First of all, right now I'm going to buy any five miles when I come and hold for the last
shares.
Okay.
All right.
I'll beat my eye.
Yeah, yeah, not a problem, but anyway.
Yeah, that's what my, because they were going to give me in the five to be honest with you.
But I'm not going to argue half of her said, okay.
So that's what I'm thinking because there's no way you can change the,
I'm better off to buy it anyway and trade and get rid of it, right?
Instead of taking a lease and getting rid of it, you tell me what you think is smarter.
Yeah, buy it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
100%.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah.
So hey, if you don't hear from me in Monday, I will get there.
You call me or I call your, that's my goal.
Now, how long do you think it really will take for a turbo?
I'll be two years.
You're not going to be trying to get lucky.
You're going to try to do two years.
Okay.
And I need to opt for, oh, did you talk to long ago?
Does he remember me?
I haven't seen it.
I haven't seen it.
We talked.
Okay.
See, we've gone the other day and, yeah, no big deal.
He's a great guy.
Push her, mark the desk.
Oh, great guy.
Yeah, he's got a couple of nice prizes for us.
Oh, yeah, he does.
So, um, what was I thinking?
No, I tell you, you really hook up with me or hook up with it.
Because they want you to do the wrong.
And maybe they still could.
I don't know.
We don't need to know that stuff until the car comes in, which is going to be several months.
So, if you want to secure this allocation, you know, let's go.
your lab, that part of them.
The lending stuff is month away.
Yeah, that's true.
I'm going to get lucky and hit it.
Jack got you by that.
There you go.
That Jack talked about coming in until August 26th of next year.
But anyway, so, yeah, you give, let's hook up on Mungy.
And we'll go from there.
Okay.
This part could be an approximately win.
Somewhere between the end of October and the middle of December.
Okay.
And then when we snag it.
Okay, that's fine.
Okay.
We'll hook up our money for sure.
Okay, thanks, Pete.
Yeah, thank you.
Take care.
Yes, sir.
Mungy.
Bye.
