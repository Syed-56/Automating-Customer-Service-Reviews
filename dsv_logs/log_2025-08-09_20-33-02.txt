find it. Thank you for all the traffic. This is Harry, how can I help you? Yeah, are you
a new car sale? Yeah, sure. Yeah. So I'm looking at buying a ZL6 port. Okay. And what's your
process on buying that? Do I just come and give you the positive order of the car? Yeah,
you're like looking at order one specifically. Yeah. And then I believe I was I believe
that employee pricing would apply to a ZL6 track. I believe so. I know that just recently
changed. I definitely double check and find out for sure. But I do believe that's
the case. And then as that is a recent change as we're before, you know, you could not use
it with it. What was your name? Right. My name is Brian Molnar. Okay. And looking to get
order like a 20. Yeah, a ZL6 or 20, 20. Yeah, or 20, 20, 20, 20. I'm going to
retire from Ford in a couple years. And I'm going to pull the trigger on this car. I don't
think I'm there yet. But I know like, and don't take this the wrong way. But I know that
dealers earned a penalty on and you work for a owner and some of you, some of these Chevy owners
are a bunch of cock suckers. I'm sorry to say that. They'll just couch people over sticker
on cars and some wall. So I know that ZL6 is now from I talk to a couple other dealers,
not locally. And there's the guys like yeah, he goes, I'll put you on the list. He goes,
I'll probably get an authorization within a couple months. I'll call you. You put it
the positive, your order, you do employee pricing. And when the car comes in, we'll deliver
it. I mean, it's pretty much at simple. Like I know before when the car came out, people
were paying, you know, thousands of dollars over sticker. I mean, I love cars, but I'll never
do that. You know what I mean? Right. Yeah, for sure. Well, we don't do that. We definitely
under that pricing. So we're not marking it up or anything like that. But yeah, if you wanted
to, you know, we take a thousand dollars and responsible deposit for any orders. And you
know, once the bank opens up, we place your order. I want to say it's about a two month
turnaround. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And typically let me ask you this question. And if you could
tax me your name and your number, you got my number. Text me your name in your number. And
I'll put it in like phone as a contact card. I just want to understand the process because
I've been told like, I've been told you can, you can employ twice the zero six now because
the ZR ones came out. What are you guys getting any UCR one authorizations or no? No, I don't
believe so. You don't believe you guys are okay. I can double check. I know it. Yeah. And typically
I'm like, I'm that color. I mean, you guys is part of the RPS or do you sell them? Oh, like
over sticker. I mean, you don't. Oh, if we had a ZR one, it would get sold over sticker probably.
Yeah. I forget it would. Okay. Yeah. All right. Yeah. To be a favorite text here, text me or info. And I'm
going to probably pull the trigger on this. Maybe that year. Yes, probably. I mean, because, you know,
it's just like I'm playing around. I want to defer. Do I want to blue one with black stripes?
So I want to convert a bowl. Do I want to cool? Do I want to clean wheels? Do I want
cat wheels? And dear, you know, I'm not going to just jump into the spurts of that 160 grand. You
know what I mean? No, for sure. You take your time to make sure it's the right one. Yes, or yes,
or no, I appreciate talking to you. And I'm glad now I can buy the car for me. I don't have
to buy the thing and get it because you're relying on the employee pricing. Yes, we will. All right.
Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Okay. Have a good day, Brian. I'll shoot you my info when we get you up.
Okay. Yep. Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. All right. Thank you.
