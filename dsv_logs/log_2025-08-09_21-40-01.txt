Thank you for calling, group Toyota. This is Brian and sales. How many I assist you?
Can I speak to somebody in new truck sales?
Yes, sir, what can I do for you?
You've got a truck listed there. It's a Tundra 2025. It's blue with tan leather interior.
I think it's a 1794. I'm not real familiar with Toyota truck. I believe that's what it is selling.
It's about $70,000.
Yep, I see it right here. It looks like it just landed in the blue print color.
That's the one.
That'll hand interior.
Yeah, so a couple quick questions for you. One is, as I'm just browsing through these trucks, I see that a lot of them are discounted.
Anywhere from $6 to $10,000.
And then some of them have no discount at all. Is there a discount on that truck or is it priced?
So this truck already currently has just about $3,000 discount on it.
Does that vary by dealer or by the potential model of the truck?
I don't have a computer, you know, a lot of things, but I mean, it would be more of dealer and how long they've had the truck.
For example, we have one here that has been here 86 days and it's discounted the same.
So I would imagine it's just the truck then because we have one that's been here for 86 days with $3,000 discount.
And we have another one with another $3,000 discount that just arrived today.
Okay.
And it looks like they vary from 50 to 70,000. Is that pretty much it?
For hundreds, yes, sir, but it depends on trim.
And depends on a lot of other things. It depends on trim packages, what everything includes here.
But what's your name, sir?
It's Rick and the last name is Colleton, to ULLEETOL.
And Rick, is this a good number to reach in case things?
Yes.
For all four.
And.
There are one. You can text me your call.
Okay, perfect. And then is this a blue print 1794, so if you want to come in and take a look at today?
I won't be able to get down there today, but I'm in for Collins.
I wanted to see if I could work out a couple other things before I made the trip up there.
Are there any options not on that truck?
What exactly do you mean not on this truck?
I mean, is there?
I'm just not definitely going to put it all to dip for somebody.
If I saw it had a bed liner in it already,
and that's not a spray in. That had a plastic insert, that liner, correct?
It is a spray on.
Oh, it's a spray out. Okay.
In the way of just options, I don't know if you've come with it.
It have all of the safety stuff, your lane change,
has up the display, does it have vintage seats?
Does it have heated seats?
Is there anything that was left off of this one?
It was ordered that this might be something I'd want to have?
No, sir.
So this is the 1794, which is essentially the top trim here for the
Tundra. The only thing that,
I mean, I really can't think of anything that this one wouldn't have.
This one has massaging front seats. You have the heads of display.
You're going to have the heated and ventilated seats.
Heat it's steering wheel. You'll have the floor mats.
So I mean, this truck is, and then all of the safety features, the Toyota's
safety fence 3.0. So you'll have lane assist, dynamic radar cruise control,
regular cruise control, blind spot monitors with rear cross traffic alert.
So I mean, this truck will basically have just about anything that you can have in a Tundra.
So there's not enough, so I don't need to worry that there's an option that was available that's not on this truck.
Yes, sir.
I mean, this truck is essentially the top of the line, and then it also has the
Teredi off road package and the Teredi front skid plate.
So I mean, you're also getting some extra things on this one that normally wouldn't be on a lot of other
1794 tundras. So I mean, this is the biggest screen option.
Moonroof, the beautiful saddle tan interior. I mean, this truck is basically fully loaded.
Okay. Is, I don't know anything about these in the way of bed size and cab size.
Is it just one cab size to a Tundra?
No, sir. We have five and a half feet bed, and then a six and a half foot bed.
But the six and a half foot is going to be a lot harder for you to find with,
essentially, I mean, it's pretty random.
We have six and a half foot beds in a lot of different trims, but it is not as accessible as you would imagine.
Five and a half foot is definitely the more standard size.
Okay. And what about the cab? So they all just are ready to crew cab?
Yes, sir.
Okay. So the only variance in the body is going to be an extra foot bed, which is going to make the truck a foot longer.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
All right. I'll leave you with just two questions. One is, well, I guess I'll start with the with the with the harder of the two.
This is a gift for somebody.
I'm going to pay for this with a wire transfer. But they obviously don't know that I'm buying this to wedding gift for my son-in-law.
And they wouldn't know about this until the end of September.
So paperwork becomes a little bit of an issue. And I just went through this little logo. We bought a ribbon for my son for his birthday.
And the paperwork got a little bit complicated because we wanted to have the truck there for his birthday.
But he didn't know about it and didn't sign. Have you ever dealt with something like this before?
So that does make a little tough. So I mean, here's my question. We when you say paperwork, you're saying you put the truck in his name.
But since he wasn't aware of it, it was made it a little bit more difficult for him to actually sign everything because he wasn't aware or was it just not ready for him?
The truck was ready and in the end. I just forged his name and they look the other way.
Oh, okay. So typically, I mean, that is where it gets a little bit trickier because if you were buying the truck, but everything is in his name.
If the truck will be under your son-in-law's son-in-law, correct? Yes.
So yeah, I mean, if the truck would be in your son-in-law's name, but you're the one purchasing, it would make a little bit tougher because I do not believe we would let, like,
unfortunately, I'm not sure if we would be able to just look the other way because there's quite a lot of documents that need to be signed.
We typically need, like, if it's going to be in his name, we would need his driver's license, his insurance.
We would need a lot of documents from him.
Okay. So then if we go about this, what about doing this a completely different way?
What if I was to pay you for the truck?
The wedding is out of state. They're going to fly back into Denver.
I give him a picture of the truck and maybe he's going to take one of the key.
I give him a key and a picture of the truck is a wedding gift.
They fly into Denver, drive over to you on the way back from the wedding, sign the paperwork and drive the truck back to what college.
So that would be, because here's how I imagine this.
The first thing, let me get a quick question as well for you just so I can help understand everything.
Are we looking at, because you said it wouldn't be until end of September, correct?
That you would be picking it up, correct? I'll pay you for the truck in full now.
Okay. So that's what I was curious about.
So that I would have to look into because we typically wouldn't hold a car for that long.
Because I mean, that would still be out another month and a half.
But I can actually imagine you're here and kind of see what we can do to make it work here for you.
But I'm from Austin and I buy most of my cars there.
And the only other car I've ever bought in Colorado is at Rivian. And it became a little bit painful.
Just don't, I mean, I don't know anybody here. There's nobody that I use to deal with.
As a matter of fact, the dealership here, I tried to buy a truck from Peterson.
I can't even get them to return my phone calls. I've never experienced those strange.
And I guess it's just been Austin all my life. Those guys know me.
And the bend over backwards for me. And they've offered to ship me and suck all the way from Texas to Colorado.
It just doesn't seem like the practical way to go about it.
So here's what I'm going to do then. So what's a good email for you Rick?
Just like my last name except for the last on the end of it.
Okay. So I'm going to see how we can make this work for you.
Because I understand it's a surprise. And so you want to try to have him not really know.
And so, you know, about the truck until the date of the truck here.
I think the other option also would be, I mean, probably the best option,
the way that we can have this truck paid. And in his possession,
best way would just be to get him in here as soon as possible.
Because we have one of these that just arrived here on the ground today.
And the one that you're reaching out about.
And then we have two other blueprint 1794s coming in.
But, you know, looking at today's date and the end of September,
I can't guarantee that those will still be available.
So they don't want, in other words, you don't think that dealership you work at would want to sell me
a truck, get paid in full parking truck there for six weeks.
And then have somebody pick it up.
No, so that's not the issue at all.
I'm just, because everything is going to be in his name.
More us to sell the truck.
He would have to come in and do everything.
But let me just figure out here, let me just speak with one of my managers
and see what we can do here for you to kind of make this work.
So my name is Brian to BRY ANT.
I could promise you I will be giving you a call back.
I'm like Peterson.
Okay.
And Brian, if I don't pick up, just send me a text and I'll call you right back.
And all I need to know from you is what you're going to sell me that truck for.
If they'll allow me to pay for it with a wire transfer on Monday,
I'll give you a credit card today to hold the truck.
If you want to take a small deposit.
You know, give me a little bit of a discount on that truck.
Give me a total of tax-side-on license.
Tell me that he can show up like the last day of September with his insurance and hands.
And if the S&I guys won't try to rake them over the coals,
I just don't want them in there trying to sell them a bunch of stuff that you can't afford.
And then you just want to make it, if you get, I want to make it a really pleasant experience.
I'd love to have the truck in front of this house when it gets back.
And I realize that's probably not a reality.
So if we could just make this a smooth, you know, like let them get in and out of there.
And they don't try to sell them any fabric guards or anything.
It's a give me a feedback there and buy something else later.
Yes, sir. Sorry. Let me get to work here then for you.
And then I'll retry back out to you Rick. That's how I'm good.
Sounds good, Brian. Thank you very much.
Of course. Thank you. I'll speak to you soon.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
