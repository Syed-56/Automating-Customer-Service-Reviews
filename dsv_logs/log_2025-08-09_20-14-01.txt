So I got good news.
Better news than what Aziz did for you.
We got the approval here.

And that allowed us to help.
They were requesting a lending fee of $631, which we took care of.
But they are going to do a little bit more down.
But they're asking for $1,500 down, but it would include the trailer.
And with trailer, everything, it's going to put you at $4 or $2 a month.
$2.
Yeah.
And that's what it does trailer, right?
Yeah, that includes trailer registration, license place, everything.
The only thing you would need is a life vest and sticker kit to put your NFL numbers on the boat.
