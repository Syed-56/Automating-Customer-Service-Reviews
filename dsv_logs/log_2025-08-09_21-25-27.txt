Hello.
Good morning.
This is Shalia.
John, I'm just your call.
Absolutely.
No, no.
This is Jean.
No, no.
No, no.
Yes.
Magic gave me a number and say, you know, to call you and find out what you're looking for.
You know, I had a conversation between me and David and he's manager about Toyota is vain.
Yeah.
But they said they would give me an all to say, yes, you can't start processing.
So I don't know if they did because I spoke to him like a couple months, a couple weeks ago.
So I was away.
So I came back.
I wanted to find out the status of that.
Okay.
So you're already still out of the application and everything, right?
I'm not sure if it did.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Probably yes or no.
That was why he's saying you said.
Yeah.
What is the name of that?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
What you was did?
What I said is for a business.
So it has to be five years warranty.
So it should be probably a brand new car, I guess, because you're going to transport like
elderly, as I'm a people, things like that.
So the company that I'm working with asking a five years.
Round two.
Five year warranty.
Mm hmm.
Okay.
So it has to be something going to transform to put handicapped.
Yeah.
Okay.
It has to be smart.
We have a drive.
Where do you have a company to transform it for you already?
No, I don't have anything like that.
Even I need to wrap up the car with the name of my company.
I don't have none of that yet.
You know, I haven't even working on the car getting the car and how to get the car.
So I didn't find out anything about else.
Okay.
Well, I think we had some experience with that already.
I think there's a company that do those things.
I think for transform it, I think it costs about, I think, $20,000 for them to do the transformation.
To, you know, they take the van, and want to buy the van, the ticket, and the transform it for you.
That's an additional, that's an additional.
I know, but it's going to be step by step.
First, I need to know, because what we discussed, me and Daisy, it's like the company that I opened last year, it's only about to be one year.
And I do not want the car to be registered under my name.
I want the car to be registered under the business.
But they don't use response.
He said the business is brand new.
So I need about three or four years.
He said, I don't remember exactly.
But I can't have the car registered on solar jobs.
It has to be strong care.
But yes, we under the business got it.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
So in cases like this, quickly, do you have somebody to put down down them?
All we discussed was like between two and three thousand.
Just to pay the insurance or taxes or whatever.
The three to four thousand.
I mean, two to three thousand will be represented.
Okay.
I got you.
Oh, just for that.
Okay.
Because we had, I had to make still before this, you are going to need a few things.
So of course, what you said about the three, you know, if you're going to find it under a business name,
there need some, your needs, you know, the finances of the business before the finance business.
That's number one.
Okay.
You said finance the business.
What, what you mean by that?
That means before, I mean, basically, if you, if you take the car under the business name,
they're going to find it's very cool under the business name.
Yes, that's what I want because the business has all the paperwork.
And I do have about 20 clients and pending.
I can't click anything because I don't have a call for them.
Okay.
Well, unless, how about you?
Because if it is a business, how about your credit?
How is it?
Last I checked, it was a little bit 600.
Not above that.
It could be less because I was away for 33 days, you know, you use a lot of credit cards.
I'm right.
So it could go down a little bit.
So I'm not sure how much that is, but it's not going to be less than 585 or close to 60.
I mean, six.
Okay.
All right.
So what I would suggest is maybe if you take can take it a trip here, what we'll do is that you would be the co-signer for the business.
It would be the deal would depend on your credit, basically.
Okay.
What I can do, let me see if I can find a co-signer for the business instead.
Yeah, of course, sorry.
Okay.
If my credit is low, that low, I cannot be co-signed, don't you think?
Well, it depends on how low is low because if you have established credit, you know, even if it's
a good company, how low is low for you guys in the 500.
Okay.
500 is the low that you can give somebody a car.
Yes, exactly.
That's not putting, you know, the bank's not going to like it.
Oh, five.
Okay.
So it has to be what?
That's what I'm asking.
I'll see if it is high sixes.
High sixes.
High sixes.
Oh, you're not.
Would be good.
Okay.
Okay.
Sixes and not.
Okay.
So I don't think I am on the sixes and not.
It could be 584, 85, 86.
I'm not sure.
You know what?
Yeah.
How about you currently working for a company?
No, this is my company.
I just want to spend time.
You just, you're okay.
All right.
You pay yourself?
Yes.
I don't have, I paid myself, but I haven't run a, like I said, a payroll yet.
Okay.
So again, you need a car to start the business.
Yeah.
You can't start the business without a car.
Right.
Oh, I still have all the requests, but we request need a car to assess.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
Gotcha.
All right.
So I would suggest that you, if you were to come in, then we can chat a little bit more.
You know, you can chat a little bit more.
Yeah.
I want to time you close because I'm not cool.
That is an New York.
Oh, you're living.
Oh, we close.
I have a day, it's not a good time to do that because it's too busy.
Yeah.
I was saying that it's sometime in the middle of the week or something like that.
And then you can give me a call and you can call me and then you can chat and then figure
out, you see how we can figure things out for you.
I know.
You're just starting your business and it's not easy.
That is it.
Okay.
Okay.
I know.
Okay.
But that number is your desk, right?
This number.
Yes.
That's my desk number.
Yes.
