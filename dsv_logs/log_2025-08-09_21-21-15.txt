I
Have this reaching the sales department. I'll help you
Hi, I was just starting to brand an I'm sorry didn't catch your name. My name is Rishi
We see okay, I wish you this bob take I'm open Minnesota. I was talking to Brandon as in questions
As long as you're color on out of trader
It's the I'm a few chance to bring in it all or be just picking up the phone here
Yeah, I'm just picking up the phone. I don't know anything about the conversation. So I'll have to backtrack here
Sure, no problem. So I'm trying to brand it. I'm in Minnesota. I found
I found this you guys have a 2020 Toyota Highlander
list if for 29 300 something
And I
Had a couple questions for him on it. He just make sure
That it wasn't a smoker car and everything smelled fresh and clean inside
Or hadn't been a smoker car
you show
And then
As some question I want to confirm that it had oil coolers and things that come with the tow package
Okay, but it wasn't a smoker car. I personally took this on trade from a
Family it was the white car. They treated in two cars. It's in a full runner. So they didn't smoke at all
So that I can confirm that it was never a smoker car
now
now your second question was the
tow
Dany issue to can't pull the windows ticker
So what was the question now the question was I plan on using the vehicle the tow?
occasionally
Okay, nice and I'll set the v6 so you know for the steps and I'm finding online that you're having five thousand pound towing capacity
But there is some I couldn't quite get clarity on whether all v6 has had the extra oil coolers for towing or just some of
Did so I wanted to just make sure that this one had that
So I think it sounds like you can check pretty quick by just looking in front of the radiator
There should be like another cooling
Pack in front of the radiator. Okay, I can I can run out there and double-check that real quick
But then you know, maybe we can I'm 99% sure that it's there. I just want to
Make sure since I'm in Minnesota and I guess
that's the other part of it is what can we work out for
You know being able to
Make a deal over the phone
Maybe put some money down and then have you hold the vehicle and then I come down and just confirm everything is as we talk on the phone and sign and
Start my journey home
Yeah, so let me go to that and we'll work out the numbers. We'll send you what we have
Versus our numbers because I'm not to look up, but Minnesota taxes are in fees. Do you have an idea what the taxes are that there?
I
Don't for sure. Okay, so I'm gonna figure that part out so then I can give you the the full price
And then we can get you everything works out. I wouldn't get you coming in but let me go take a picture of picture of the under the hood
That I have no idea where I'm looking at
Didn't know to have an extra oil coolers effort towing so I'm just gonna take a video of it and send it to you
To just seven number
Yep, that's great. Okay, let me send a video
I'm gonna give the key send a video that way you have it and then I'll call you back and go over the pricing once
I forgot the taxes up there you're in clear clear Lake Minnesota
Yeah, okay, and we find that forgot the taxes and fees and then I can
Work out some numbers and send it over to you and I don't go from there
Okay, sounds good. Thank you. Thank you
