All the Chantilly services?
Your high-performance, self-performance.
Welcome to Honda of Chantilly. Your summer adventure headquarters.
We're glad to see keeping you and your vehicle safe and safe.
Thank you for calling on the Chantilly. This is Bob, speaking of our electricity.
Yeah, hi. I'm interested in getting some info about the least of the gig I got on on the road log.
Yes, sir. This is so easy.
It's the two, six, nine a month, 24 months, zero down.
Yeah, for a church. That is on the toying term level.
And it's zero down, sir. It just excludes your state's health tax.
It's going to be much easier going to register it in. So, it's Virginia.
It just excludes Virginia state's health tax.
Your tags and registration in the 989 dealer processing.
Yes, sir.
So, here's this scenario and maybe you can help me with it.
I'm buried in an electric car that I bought and I'm trying to get out of it in the cheapest way possible.
So, I'm hoping, you know, to use some of the incentives on that lease to cover the negative equity.
So, I'm interested in seeing just, you know, how far can I hold you to it, but like, what kind of thing?
I mean, I'd be looking at, right.
I mean, without seeing your trade and I wouldn't be able to know that ballpark wise, but as far as our special, sir, I mean, you consider our pro-long lease special.
It's a 24-month lease for $2.69 on the pro-long flooring.
And it just excludes putting your Virginia state tax tags to your processing.
And it's been our most popular special that we have going on between all of our special.
So, 24-month lease. It's a traditional zero down, sir.
But, again, it just requires your state tax title license in your dealer processing.
Yeah, yeah. So, is it possible that can you speak with one of the finance people?
I mean, it's a considerable amount of negative equity. It's about $17,000.
So, what I'm trying to find out is, like, before I wake anybody's time is, like, right.
You know, is that going to be, like, a $1 payment or is it going to be something more reasonable?
Right. Then, I see based off the phone number, I mean, you've done business with us in the past when it comes to, you know, when you're better to take care of you, sure, you definitely love to do that.
And it's just that rule of thumb, sure, every $1,000 is about $25 to $30 of, they get added onto your monthly payment.
Okay. Even in the lease, too. Even on the lease, yes, sir.
Okay. So, like, with $17, that would be, like, $17,000. Would you say $20,000?
So, $25, yes. I don't even know what that is. It's $4,000. It's $4.25.
So, I think, I mean, the numbers of sides are releasing and everything.
I definitely think you'd be $1,000 for sure.
Well, so right now, $1,500, we need to be, like, you know, under that, for sure.
Like, that's what I'm trying to figure out. Like, would this be, like, $600 lease or would it be, like, the exact payment for paying right now?
And I mean, without seeing that hard-turns and seeing the exact negative equity to the, to the penny, I wouldn't be able to know what to top of my head.
I think on the prologue, you'll have only a line by because of the low cost.
There are lots of fines in your scenarios that have come in with lots of negative equity.
Behind the prologue is this one vehicle in Honda line. I can absorb the most negative equity just because of the $7500 tax rebate and then all of the rebates up on the housing on with loyalty, of less, et cetera.
I wasn't with your email. I told this like, you know, because if you
called the same system, it's very few here. Maybe 20 minutes away. I'm sure
what your schedule is like today tomorrow. Yeah.
You're a little bit. Yeah, I don't want to come in, but just so you know,
just to get in the order. Not to make it, frankly. Yeah, I've seen some
stuff happen. And in the end of the day, the numbers don't, don't make
sense or I promise you wouldn't wait for your whole day at being.
Yeah, yeah.
Perfect. All right. Yeah, so I'll be, uh, I can free by about, I don't know, 25 minutes or so.
You're gonna be around. Me personally, no, sir, but I can put you in contact her
with my colleague. Um, please, uh, when you arrive, I have to speak to me. Is this a
phone number? Sure. I can send you a message from it. It is. Yeah.
Are you done for the day? You got to know this stuff? No, sir. I do. I just said,
I'm currently sitting next to you. Uh, best next year, sir. I have an appointment here.
That's already here in size. Yeah. Okay. What, what are you?
What, what are you? What is the, what is the, until about 14? Yeah, I'm sure. Oh, okay. So,
yeah, who else you got? Did I pull the help? You know, I got one of my colleagues over here,
service me. Um, I have a colleague here saying, his name is going to be O'Mari.
Yeah, he actually personally has a Honda Pro Log. He should be able to take care of him and be
available on the toilet. Everything that we spoke about. But so when you get here, sir, I
have to speak to me and, uh, and, and I'll make sure that you get put into the, into the writing.
Okay. What's your name, Jim? My name is Fabio. Fabio. Fabio. Okay. Sounds good. And I appreciate your
help. All right. I'm taking you right on my phone. Great. Nice. Thank you so much.
