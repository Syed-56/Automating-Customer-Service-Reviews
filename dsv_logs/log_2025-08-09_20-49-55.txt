Transcript:
Thank you, which is the person's view of decision.
I'm high John. I was calling about, you guys have a 2018 board up 150 rafters.
Let me just double check on that. Give you one second.
Okay.
That's so we have it.
But let me triple check. We're long doing that.
We're looking at coming in today to take your first spin.
I don't think I'll be able to make it in today.
I was calling to see if what if it was available.
And then if you guys have value, like have a rough value on my trade-in.
Well, we'll definitely love to do that when you read the vehicle.
Have you had a phrase before?
I did it a lot, but I'm tame.
Okay.
Oh, yeah. That's about it.
Okay.
Give me a second answer. What was your name?
First last is Eric.
Eric.
Eric.
Okay.
G-I-R-K.
Okay.
Oh, E-I-R-E-R-K.
Okay.
I thought you were saying your last name.
That was a good point number, Eric.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
What were you looking at trading in?
Um, it's a 2024, uh, Durango Alcat premium.
Got just under 12,000.
It's like 11,000, like, something under miles on it, right now.
Okay.
And how was you still on it?
Um, I'd have to log in, Jack.
About.
Give or take?
Um, I'd say six views.
Six views, okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Which I always do similar to that as a company, uh, around about number, but to get the most accurate number,
we'll definitely need to look at the vehicle.
Um, what's the way the engine is standing on.
Yeah.
What was it about the reactor that you like?
Oh, you know, I'm just trying to, you said it 23, right?
But the,
No, they, they're 18.
Okay.
You're saying?
I was just trying to cut my, my payment down over it now.
That's all.
Jack here.
Jack here.
Um, you know what?
It's of course right now.
Everything's slow.
Um, so you think maybe my near two zigt is drop on it.
We can look at your car and show you the truck.
Um, I'd have to track that, um, try and get out there.
I'm like in Brighton, so it's kind of far.
Um, I live in West Newfield, so,
a little bit of a drive.
Yeah.
Sorry for the wait.
Okay.
That's it worse than I telling someone the vehicles here and I can see it,
but then there's a hold on it, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, you're listening.
What do you have your car praise that, uh, last one, too?
Um, they're going to give me 74.
64.
Hey, that's your car.
That, that works.
Yeah.
Um, you know,
there's time to see options as far as like different rafters that are in the area.
Got you.
Got you.
Yeah.
All right.
So if I got to the screen.
Uh,
there's, uh, ending in zero, zero, five, two, one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That one is still available.
Okay.
As of right now.
Um, I tell people all the time we've got 12 people here,
all family vehicles at the same time.
So if this is something that you really want to get your hands on,
it's suited a better.
Yeah.
Do you have any other questions?
I can't do it.
Um, not really.
I just, I'm sorry.
Like if far as you guys think you could be roughly in the same ballpark.
Like if I don't want to end up having to take off work and come out there and you guys are like,
we're at 68 and I'm a bit.
Whatever.
Yeah.
You're on your way.
That would be,
I'll pay it over.
It's number because we didn't do it.
Yeah.
