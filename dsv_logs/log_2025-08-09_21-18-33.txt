Thank you for coming on the Mall.
Georgia, this is time and fair.
How can I help you?
Hey, how are you today?
Good.
Good.
Do you guys have a, I think you just have a 2026 on the civic
Alaska stuff, like a silver?
Is that correct?
At least that's not on your website.
How can you be a good kind of give us a call on the new ones?
Do you possibly have the stock number available?
It's available.
It's available.
Um, this one's second.
Yeah, it's, uh,
H.
Oh, no, sorry.
That's not it.
This is a sport.
I don't want to sport.
Sorry.
I'm just looking for the,
trying to get the,
I don't want the sport with the LX.
But it doesn't give me a trim now.
I don't know where I found the trim last time.
Sure.
What was it again?
You said, uh,
Bond is the big L.
Oh, civic Alex.
Okay.
Yeah.
And it was,
Oh, I got it.
It was a, it was a good thing.
I got it.
Yeah, I got it.
Um, are you ready?
Yeah.
Okay.
It is, um,
um,
each five zero nine,
one,
three, five.
Okay.
I think I see here,
26 Alex is still warm correct.
Yeah.
How many miles does it have?
Want it right now?
Do you know?
Sure.
So I had to put my hands on it,
but usually with new cars,
there should be below,
I would say range from,
you know, below 10 to 20.
You know,
it's just a matter of,
um,
how long it's been here and things like that.
But let me do this for you.
I do want to make sure it's available,
man.
Um,
and I want to put my hands on things like that.
Okay.
I just got put you on a brief,
but I'm going to go back to the chat on it.
You know,
um,
it should have been turned on.
What was your name to give me?
Re-new,
R-E-E-N-U.
Okay.
So I see you.
And I see you call.
687 number.
That's a good comment.
Number three case,
something happens, right?
Yeah.
I can wait.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So let me check on a real quick.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
I can't wait to see you.
Okay.
All right.
Miss Re-N-U-S is there?
Yes.
Thanks for the patience.
I don't seem like I do have this one available,
so that's good news there.
Um, real quick.
Are you going to be straining anything in for this comment?
Just reading?
Or are you looking just the purchase?
Uh, just a question right now.
Okay.
Um,
Yeah.
I mean,
so I guess I just come down to thinking about the time for you to stop by to take a look at it.
Miss Re-N-U-N-U.
When would you be able to do that?
I've got how many miles.
I want to know how many miles are on it.
So could you confirm that?
So I don't know how much it's been driven.
Okay.
It's a brand new call like Symmas Re-N-U.
Um, and I could send you a picture of it,
but it should be below 20.
Okay.
All right.
And these cars don't have power seats, right?
No power seats, no ma'am.
And all the Alex's are like that?
Yeah.
Alex is basically like the baseball on the city,
so they don't really have any of the accessories
of the dim on the sensing and the data's cruise control.
Yes.
You said adaptive cruise,
and but they all have the screen, right?
And size?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You get the car phone.
You want to just,
you won't get the,
it's wired.
It's not wireless.
What's wired?
What do you mean?
You have to plug it in.
You have to plug it in via USB type C.
You have to basically have to charge your phone
as you're trying to do the car play on there.
Oh, okay.
But all the Alex have that flip screen in there.
The screen that's on the gas?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what I mean.
So that screen on the dash is car play,
but the only wired.
So you can,
if you can bluetooth it,
but it's not going to pop up like, you know,
the screen,
the phone screen on there.
That's fine.
But this is standard for all Alex, right?
They have like the all methods.
Yes.
Yeah.
Standard for all Alex.
Okay.
And then I have another question.
What are like the,
does this pricing include like,
I don't want to make the trip out there because you guys are far.
So you guys offer like much less the tinted window.
What do you guys offer?
What's your warranty on the new one?
Sure.
Sure.
You say you live far away.
Are you like an hour away or two hours away?
No, but I am about an hour away.
So I just want to understand.
I've had 45 minutes something like that,
but it's an hour.
I want to understand like the warranty.
And I want to understand what you're offering.
And then I also want to understand what is the additional items
that you're like that package.
I know some places have like the,
the window,
much less, you know,
weather,
but I just want to understand what that is.
Sure.
Sure.
Yeah.
So what the ones here,
every Honda is going to be about the chain.
Three or 30,
please comprehensive five or 60 powertrain.
And we can ask where you stand because we do offer three years of free
maintenance at Honda more and Georgia.
But I'll,
since you only live about 45 minutes,
I would definitely take advantage of that and just come by and,
you know, get that free maintenance on the car.
As far as the accessories,
we do have accessories on all the cars,
which is here on my.
It's just as you see,
there's just MSRP sales price, whatever you want to call it.
If you don't want to see the full display of it,
I can definitely send you over a quote,
but, you know,
it's the full price of our accessories includes all with the mass
transfer space flash cards,
you get the flex effect or a similar product, the low drag and window tint.
So,
and the MRMRP,
the weather masks, everything is included.
No, no, no, no.
So that's what I mean.
It's the online pricing you see.
MSRP is just the sales price.
Yes.
Does it include the accessories and it doesn't include taxes and fees?
I understand that.
I want to know the accessories.
Like some places,
they have a package, right?
It's the offer that much flaps of tinting,
some offer wheel locks, some offer, you know,
like the cargo, right?
So the cargo matter something.
So tell me,
do you have any package like that?
How much is it?
Yes, we did.
Yeah.
And that's what I mean is if you want to see the full picture of this
menu, it's better for me to show you than tell you.
So I would say,
I'm not coming to the sit.
This is not making me come in.
It really is.
So please just tell me the price over the phone so I can make an informed
decision and we don't want to come out there or not.
Well, absolutely, right?
But if I give you the price and on it as far as the accessories go,
you're not including all the taxes.
I want to show you the full picture.
I want to know what it is.
No.
About three grand.
Three grand for the accessories?
Yes, ma'am.
And that includes which?
Can you tell me again?
Yes, ma'am.
Can you include the all-way match-run trace flashcards,
the flex protect and windows.
Okay, but aren't some of those items optional?
No, ma'am.
So on our vehicles, once they come to the on the lot and this one's
going to be a couple of days.
Once you get through our inspection, it's all already installed.
It is no way for us to remove it.
Okay.
All right.
And that's an additional 25-sum for five.
No.
It's three grand this week.
That's what I'm saying is it's better for me to send it to you.
You can look at it.
And I can take that off.
Yes.
I've called two other dealerships, right?
And the part that you're giving me is like three times more
what they're saying.
And they're the exact same car.
Dave all go to me.
The car go Matt.
The pin pain.
And then the all season Matt.
I think there's one other item.
1395, both of them.
So how are you guys 3,000?
Well, Mr. and that's what I mean.
I mean, maybe they give me a discount and who knows, right?
I had to see the full picture.
And if you have the actual call on you, do you have like the
the the the J. screen they show you or not.
You're a file like the paper form.
Right.
Take your picture email you anything.
Yes.
Yeah, they do.
But I'm not I'm not I'm going to like I'm not going to tell you
what stewardship it is.
But that's the game.
No, ask.
And they and then they stuff like the security is optional.
Like I don't have to take that and you're telling me I have to take it.
Okay.
Well, like you said, I mean, it comes down in the grocery.
I mean, if they're giving you that price and there's no way that would be that far apart from another dealership.
And you know, in our range here.
You know, you're asking me what my accessories I'm telling what it is.
But you're telling me you just start a price that again, I'm trying to.
So I want to send it over to you a quote.
You can see what the full picture is, man.
It's you know, it's a lot of things that go through is that not just, you know,
what is the exercise?
What is the sales price?
Because when you're talking about, you know, you know, from the issue,
the dealership desk, every accessory is different.
Every accessory has a different pricing.
But it's a matter of, you know, what kind of deal is it going, right?
I mean, I don't know what you're, what you're going to do.
What's the work?
We're, we're, we're, I feel like we're kind of going to circles.
I, you mentioned the security in there with the 3000 fact.
I don't want the security and I know that that's optional as two or three other deal.
Like at least two other deal with respect to that book too.
They're like, no, you don't have to take that.
And they said, you don't have to take, I think you also mentioned some kind of like coding.
I don't know if that was correct.
But we can not pick that either.
It's, it's all in that really fast.
So it's, it's all with the math, Trump trade, splash guards, window tent,
and then the flush detector.
The flush protector, what, what's that?
Which is, which is, which is the, which is the low jack base.
So yeah.
So the, what, the, what you learn?
The low, the flush detector is basically a product.
Like you said, it's the one where,
you know, if you're able to get stolen, they're fine within hours.
So it's a similar product to flush the detector.
It's like, oh, yeah, I don't want, I don't want that.
So why, why do I have to take that?
Well, absolutely right.
It's already been a solid, but like it said, man, if, if that's something you're, you know,
you're, you're adamant on and I can get you to take that.
If I can get my meditate that off, I mean, again, you don't,
you're not seeing the full picture, man.
So that's what I'm telling you is, I can tell you a quote.
You let me know what you want to be at in the weekend kind of side.
If that's something for you to drive on and take a look at.
what I did in that man, I just, I don't have a way for us to go to.
You understand what I'm saying?
That's fine.
Okay.
Well, thanks for your help.
I'll, thank you.
Yeah.
And I'll, yeah.
