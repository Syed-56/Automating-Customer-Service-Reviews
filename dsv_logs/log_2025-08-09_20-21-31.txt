Thank you for calling Naples Ag.
You're on the list.
I need to see if you have a vehicle available that's online.
Yeah, I'll be more than happy to help.
We'll do have a pleasure speaking to you.
Just a Jennifer.
Hi, Jennifer.
My name is Tristan.
More than happy to help you here.
Which car are you going to stop number?
Yeah, take a stop number.
Is it a new or pre-owned vehicle?
Pre-owned.
Pre-owned, okay.
I'll take the stop number whenever you're ready.
Mary, 7.0, 4.9, 8.2, Mary.
We just double check here.
Just to confirm that's the 2018 T-Alex.
Yes.
Yes, that car is still available.
Is there...
It is still available to come by.
All right.
I'm going to have to have you do something for me, Tristan, because I am at New Homestead.
Yeah, I'll be more than happy to help.
I'm going to need you.
I don't know if it's right in over there because it's torn here.
It's dry here, so it's not...
Okay.
If you could...
I am extremely particular about my vehicle.
My vehicle could be 10 years old and it's in late condition.
I need you to please her some of the pictures with the sun hitting it or a little deceiving.
Anything wrong with the outside or the inside as far as dings, scratches, paint, messed
up.
If you need to even FaceTime me, I need you to go inspect it for me.
Yeah, I'd be more than happy to.
And I'll run it through the car once first as well.
That way you get a clear view of the car.
I don't want to drive all the way over there.
And I'm looking at a honk on you know what?
Yeah, yeah.
I understand.
So what I'll do is...
Sorry, so I'm going to look for you.
If it's got dings and scratches all over, I don't want it.
I'm sorry, what'd you say, Tristan?
Is this a good snowfall number for you?
Yes.
Yeah.
Perfect.
And what's a good email address for you, Jennifer?
Yeah.
Perfect.
No, stop down.
And what is the code that you were coming from?
3, 3, 0, 3, 5.
3, 3, 0, 3, 5.
Perfect.
So what I'm going to do here, Jennifer, I'm going to send you an opt-in text message that
we can communicate via text and I can send you some videos and a picture all around
the car.
I mean, I've looked at the media.
I've done everything.
I'm on it right now.
There's just a couple places I'm hesitating because of the glare.
Yeah.
Is there a particular area of the car that's a little bit hard to see?
Yeah.
Something with something caught my intention.
And like I said, it might just see the glare.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Front end.
It might be water spots that I've seen.
Okay.
I remember it is.
It was definitely clean.
I can tell that part.
It's just the outside that I'm not short.
I just needed to go over it with fine tooth comb.
I'm going to go over there.
I'm going to go over there.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on for a second.
Perfect.
Okay.
I just replaced your message.
Perfect.
I received it.
So I'm going to go outside.
I'm going to go take a video of the car and send it over to you via text and we'll work from there.
Okay.
I appreciate it, City.
And if you notice scratches or like paint missing somewhere, take a picture of that for me.
Just I just don't want to drive all that way.
And I disappointed.
It's just not like it's around the corner.
Yeah.
I understand.
Yeah.
I'll make it as clear and transparent as possible for you.
Okay.
First in thank you, City.
Of course.
We'll keep in touch.
Okay.
Bye bye.
