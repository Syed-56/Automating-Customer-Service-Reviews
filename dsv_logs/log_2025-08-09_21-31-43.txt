I think it's going to your myers to your justice to my health.
Hi, Justin.
Are you a salesman?
Yes, this is a new car sales.
I'm going to help you.
Okay.
Yeah, my name is Larry Labanowski.
I'm in the market for a 2025 land cruise.
And I'm on your website.
I'm on your website and I'm looking.
I have to admit, I don't buy new cars very often, but I'll adopt a buy one and it's pretty confusing.
But anyway, I'm looking at these prices.
I had also looked at those GX-550s, which are the Lexuses.
And I think this is pretty close to the body type to the same or something I've heard about.
But anyway, doesn't look like you guys have too many new ones.
Do you up there in your place?
I can put that up and have a look at it for you.
I don't want to get this here.
I'm sure it's already said, yeah, the good phone over there.
I can get back to you in case you got disconnected.
Yeah, the number I'm calling you from.
All right.
Bye.
All right.
All right.
And so, yes, I am looking at the inventory on the land culture if you have at the moment.
It looked like we have two of them here.
No, actually, three of them here.
One is pre-sold and the other two is available.
And if you haven't had a chance to see one or catch one in person,
you know, you're more than happy.
I'm happy to have you here and go over to the auction today.
Yeah, no, I appreciate that, Justin.
Okay, so you've got two or three that are available.
What are the colors?
I have one in Wintu Pearl, which is the pearl white.
And then they have another one comes in underground.
This kind of dark gray.
Okay, so the only colors that I'm interested in are the black.
And what is the meat?
How do you describe the meteor shower?
Is that dark gray?
What is that?
It's kind of dark gray and golden mixed together.
It's leaning towards a little bit more like silverish-roo.
Silver-slur.
Okay.
Well, yeah, I'm not interested in the white.
And I'm not interested in the, I think maybe the meteor shower in the blast of the only ones.
Let me ask you this, Justin.
This is so bizarre.
You know, there's a dirt of cars that are available.
And I don't understand why.
I mean, you can't even find cars around the by.
What's going on?
I mean, you guys have trouble getting these land cruisers in and the GX 550's in and what's the story?
Yes, those are, you know, most of the projects imported.
So, land cruisers and GX, they are 100% mate and shipped from Japan.
And also right now based on the technology and all of the engines and component in part,
they are running behind on all of them.
That's why a lot of vehicles that you don't see on the lot.
And usually, most of them comes in, has already had the owner on top of them.
Usually, from the wildest on the GX, it's kind of like at least seven months,
or a year to wait for one.
But land cruisers is a little bit more available now.
That's a reason why.
Yeah, how long do you wait for a land cruiser?
I'm sorry?
I say, how long would you have to wait for a land cruiser?
It's still depend on the colors and the options and all the equipment that you want in the vehicles.
I do have two in a year, but unfortunately, it's not the color that you consider,
but if you want it to have a black one, I do have a couple of them coming in.
Take my name and my number.
Take my name and my number.
And let's see how it goes.
Now, let's talk for just a minute about these sales prices.
I'm looking at these prices, 71,000, 951, the GX.
If a Lexus dealership is about that too.
That's what they're telling me how to take it.
The GX, how come the land cruisers are so expensive?
There's a couple different things between the GX and the land cruiser.
The first, obviously, engine size.
Lexus, they're featuring the base model, starting at somewhere around 16.
I'll find the bills that will be around 71.
In the meantime, the land cruiser, they are a fossil in the turbo and hybrid,
which is not offering a third-row seat like the GX, but, until that,
you're enjoying all of the power from the electric models that the
the engine is showing in a short-term pattern.
The options inside of the middle range are the land cruiser.
They will be putting much like the GX.
Okay, so what you're telling me in simple languages is that the GX is very similar to
the, what do you call it, to the land cruiser, and that's why the prices are about.
Is that correct?
Yes, they're using the same frame.
Yeah, they use the same frame.
Come here.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Come here.
Um, anyway.
Um, well, okay.
How, are you guys at all flexible on the price?
Can I get it for less than that price?
I mean, how firm is it?
Absolutely, sir.
We want to happy to review your options with us.
And we are flexible on pricing as well as, as far as the availability.
If we do have the card, I do you willing to purchase.
We want happy to sit down and talk about, no, I'm making you a bed to do.
Okay.
Take my name in my number.
Okay.
I, I got to tell you, Justin, I'm not a tire kicker.
I'm really going to buy a car here.
Um, I don't know if I'm going to buy it at Joe Myers, but I want to buy a car and I got
to buy it pretty soon.
I have a 2009 MDX with a hundred and fifty thousand miles and it's limping.
I'm limping along, Justin.
I'm waiting for my car to break down if you follow me.
And so I got to buy it.
I'm not going to finance it.
I'm going to take cash.
And so anyway, I'm telling you all that because I'm not just a tire kicker.
I'm not just calling you.
Um, here's what I want you to do for me if you would.
Okay.
It is don't bug me, but, but you know the words, you don't have to worry about selling
me.
Okay.
I'm going to be disrespectful, but I, you don't need to worry about selling me.
All I'm going to be interested in knowing is color interior now.
I don't need a ton of features, but I want to get a nice car.
Like for example, I was just out in Los Angeles and I was at this, uh, I was at this surf competition
and they had Toyota's on the, on the pier, on the, uh, on the, uh, on the, on the, what do you call it?
On the Hermosa Beach pier.
There was this guy there who was like and charge of it and he was a great guy.
He just, he had one of those, uh, fan color Toyota's on the pier and it had those seats
that are not leather, but they're kind of funny leather.
You know what I'm talking about?
It's like a plant based, what's that called?
That plant based leather.
It's like a, it's like a nogga hide.
Are you familiar with it?
Um, I, I, I, I, I know exactly what you mentioned about.
So what, what, what do we do this?
Um, I do have to hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on, hold on.
I'm still telling you.
Hold on.
Yes, okay.
Yeah, because I want to ask you a few questions.
Okay.
First of all, I might be interested in that plant based, um, leather seats.
Okay.
They're like it's phony leather, cimitation leather.
So I need you to find out about that for me.
Okay.
And then he told me that there was this deal where the first 5,000 they came off the assembly line had those funky pipe grills in the front, which can't get those anymore.
Are you familiar with that?
That, that, that found a little bit new to me that I can find out about that.
Yeah, we can find we find out about that.
We'll be waiting for this.
But the colors on, the only colors I'm interested in are black or maybe the media or shower.
Okay.
We're maybe that dark gray.
Those are the only three.
I don't want any of the other colors.
Don't even bother with the blues or the red for the white.
I don't want to be interested.
The interior, you know, about the exterior right?
I'm talking about the exterior.
The only colors I'm interested in are black, media or shower, and then that really dark gray.
What's the dark gray called?
Underground?
It's underground.
All right.
Those are the only experiences I'm uninterested in any other ones.
Okay.
I thought the interior's, I'll settle for black.
But, you know, I'd like to, I don't want it to be some crazy color.
You know, it, it, you know, I, I don't know.
I prefer, I don't know if it even comes with a gray.
You know, it's Houston.
I live in Houston.
So it's hot as heckier.
So anyway.
And then, can you quickly tell me what the models are as far as,
the different levels?
Can you quickly tell me what those are?
So the land cruiser, they, they offer in three trim levels available.
So the first, the really based model one is 1958.
It comes with the, the grounded headlight.
And then you have the, then you have the, the land cruiser premium models,
which is come with the square headlight.
And also you've got the first ignition, which is also comes with the,
the, the rounded headlight.
They're offering most of the available functions and equipment in that one.
But most, the one that we sell in the most is the end, the, the middle one,
the land cruiser one with the square headlight.
I guess in the 1958 is the off-road.
Is that correct?
Yes.
If it's a based model off the land cruiser.
Right. Right.
It's a very cheapest one.
And it's, is it the one that is designed to sort of go off-road or something or
now?
Yeah.
They, they, they all can go off-roading.
But the, the 1958 dude, we're missing a lot of functions.
Like, you know, they, they're not offering leather seats in there.
And then everything will be manual, like a seat, the gate, everything else.
But if you're looking,
Oh, manual, manual, manual, manual, the,
the 1958, in other words, you don't even,
you have to pull the bar in the front to get the seat.
You know that?
That's correct.
Uh huh.
That's really weird.
Okay.
How much, how much is that model?
It's, it's going around,
I'll stay around 60, 60, one.
Okay.
So it's substantially cheaper, I guess, and probably to get that price out.
And then the middle one, what's the middle one start now that?
What's the MSRP?
I mean, the base model of the, um, middle one, they starting off from, um, 61 as well.
Yeah.
What's that one called?
What's that one called?
I don't mean to keep interrupting you.
What's that one called?
It's called land cruiser.
Just plain old land cruiser.
And then, and then the last one, the best one is the premium.
Right?
Well, because in the middle one, in the land cruiser terminal,
they would have another package in there, which is,
the bank, the land cruiser would become a premium.
And then the top of the line would be a first edition.
Okay.
Tell me the principal difference when you buy the first edition,
what, what do you get that's extra that makes you paying more money?
There's a lot of future ring in there.
You know, you've got the multi-terrain selections on,
on that first edition.
And also the design also have two toner available on top of that.
You're going to have the, you know, all of the,
it's more for off-roading to tell a lot of off-roading features.
Okay.
Okay.
Ben Johnson.
Great.
I'm going to tell you.
Okay.
I just, there's just a big camera and all of that.
Okay.
Justin, I'm not interested at all in off-road stuff.
I don't need any off-road features.
I will never take this car off-road.
Okay.
So when you're looking, when you're looking for me.
Glad.
Yes, and you go ahead.
Glad.
What were you saying?
Yes, so if that's it,
okay, I think the, the middle camera will be on the back.
Okay.
Then that's the one you should look for me.
Okay.
Because I'm not going to ever go off-road.
Now, okay.
Here's the way, when I get a car, this is kind of what I need.
I bought a, I bought a Sequoia a number of years ago and they,
I got that TV that you would come down out of the roof of the Sequoia.
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah, it's good.
We never used it even one time.
Okay.
Okay.
So, so I don't need a whole bunch of extra features, but I don't want to spend
in, you know, 60 to 70,000 dollars on a new car and have it be like a crappy car.
I want to get a good car.
I hold on to my car, so I hear you.
Okay.
So, just, do me a favor and take a look around for me, see what you can find
and stay in touch with me.
My number you have.
And just remember those prerequisites, you know, that I've got.
And if I buy from Joe Myers, I'll buy from you.
What's your name?
You're asking?
Yes.
It's Justin and my last name is Nguyen.
Angie, you, I, and I can check that out.
You know, too.
So, again, yeah, yeah, take that money, Bill.
Take that money, you know, like send me your contact.
My email.
Okay.
Okay.
I got calm.
Okay.
And please don't send me, just, just, I get about 150 emails every day.
Okay.
So, I spend my first 15 minutes in the morning deleting junk.
So, please don't sign me up for any emails, just send me emails whenever you need to send me something that's an interest to me.
And I'll, that's the best way to get me is buy email.
Okay.
And when I get the first email from you, as soon as I get around to my computer, I'll go ahead and send you a response and just say,
yeah, here's my contact information.
And we'll stay in touch and maybe, maybe we'll make a deal.
And, pretty much, I prefer just, and I don't mean this in a mean way or anything like that.
I don't need to be sold.
I've been looking around for a couple of months at these Lexus cars and fooling around with it.
And so, I pretty much, I just want to know the colors, interior and exterior and some of the features that I need and then what's what I'm going to do.
And then what's kind of a price I can get and how long it will take me to get the vehicle.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
So definitely.
That right way to have that exact match for you here and stuff.
I mean, just in case you want to swing by some time and have a look at it.
But I would like any more happy to send you some information on the vehicles that you may interest it in.
So that way you can, you know, have a look in advance and, you know, not mugging you.
But, you know, we can definitely get back to me if you.
Yeah.
So, I'm coming up to this.
Did you, did you say you have, you think you have an exact match for me?
Yes, then.
Okay.
Send me information on what you think is the exact match by email in that first email that you said it and I'll run it by my wife.
And you don't need to worry about following up with me or anything like that.

I'm, I'm crammed at work.
But I'm going to move as fast as I can and, and we'll see.
